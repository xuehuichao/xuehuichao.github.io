    "description": "According to Access Northern California (http://accessnca.org/access-northern-california/explore/explore-detail-view/?site_id=34): Pacific Grove, CA is nicknamed \"Butterfly Town USA\" due to the thousands of monarch butterflies that migrate to the area each year. Every fall and early winter, thousands of Monarch butterflies travel amazing distances from the northern United States and southern Canada to spend the winter at a handful of sites along the California coast. One of these is a grove of eucalyptus and Monterey pines in the little coastal town of Pacific Grove, on Monterey Bay. To reach their overwintering sites, Monarch butterflies may travel as far as 2,000 miles, covering perhaps a hundred miles a day, and fly as high as 10,000 feet. \n\nOn a cool day, you might mistake the butterflies clustered in the trees for dead leaves, but as sunlight warms them they begin to move and take flight, filling the air with flickers of orange. They mate here, then in spring fly north in search of milkweed plants on which to deposit their eggs. Docents are on hand November through mid-February, noon-3 PM every day except Friday. The sanctuary is open from 8 AM to 5 PM daily.\n\nAccessibility: There is at least 1 designated accessible parking, van accessible, that is firm and level or with a slope no greater than 2% next to the school on Ridge Road. There are wheelchair-accessible restrooms at the trailhead at the north end of the trail.\n\nThe trail surface is a mix of cement, asphalt, and packed dirt and typically at least four feet wide. The estimated grade is typically mostly gentle (5% grade or less) and at a maximum- steep at 12% grade or less. There are benches along the route for resting. Most of the trees are in the upper area, so you can avoid going down the steep section and still get a good view."

The majority of the trail – approximately the upper 3.0 miles – is enjoyed under the cool canopy of these trees. Eventually, the trail emerges near the top onto steep terrain dominated by cliffs and rocky outcrops including serpentine boulders. Due to the thin soil layer developed on the serpentine bedrock, a low moisture-holding capacity, and a unique chemical composition, the serpentine areas support numerous endemic plant species, including rare flowering plants that continue to reveal themselves each spring."

A short, about 0.15 mile, section of the trail starting at about 0.4 miles out is along a service road. It is recommended to use caution, lights, flags, and wear a helmet and bright clothing when sharing space with the motor vehicles. \n\nAccessibility: The trail surface is gravel, compact dirt/grass, and paved trail and typically at least 5 feet wide. The asphalt portions are typically wider, estimated at 8 feet, and have a painted center dividing line which reduces the width.  There may be grass growing into the trail from the edges in sections of the route, especially in the Deer Meadow section.

The slope is estimated to be mostly gentle (5% grade or less) except for a moderately steep (5 - 8%) downhill portion when heading counterclockwise at about the 1.4 mile mark.\n\nOnly the trail up to the farm is wheelchair or stroller friendly. There is also a side connection from the Permanente Creek Trail to the Deer Meadow Trail. It is 0.62 miles long and is wheelchair and stroller friendly. It is one of those hidden trails that many hikers don’t know about.\n\nThere are at least 5 designated wheelchair-accessible parking spaces with striped access aisles at the large paved trailhead lot."

You can also begin at the trailhead adjacent to the Shelldance Orchid Gardens near CA-1 and hike up to the ridge using the Mori Ridge Trail."

This gradual route is a less-strenuous option for hiking to the top of the popular East Bay peak.\n\nIt starts from the parking lot at Ohlone College along Mission Boulevard in Fremont, California. Just one trail -- the aptly named Peak Trail -- curves and climbs its way to the 2,517-foot summit of Mission Peak. (From the parking lot, look for a sign pointing to Ohlone Trail).\n\nAbundant parking at Ohlone College on the weekend makes this trailhead a welcome alternative to the Stanford Avenue entrance which fills quickly. There's also a bit more shade on this route compared to other trails to the summit. \n\nImpressive views of the Diablo Range and San Francisco Bay open up on the way up. Don't be surprised if you see deer and coyotes the ground and raptors and vultures soaring overhead.\n\nBest time to go: Springtime when the hills are green and the wildflowers are blooming. Winter's the next-best time, especially if the peak gets a dusting of snow. Fall is OK; summer's too hot during the day, but many hikers hit the summit at sunset and hike down after dark (best done under a full moon).\n\nNO bikes are allowed on this trail."

For more information, please visit https://www.smcgov.org/parks/pescadero-creek-park-trails\n• CZU Lightning Complex Fire : Public access to Big Basin has been severely impacted by the 2020 CZU Lightning Complex Fire and ongoing fire recovery work, but the park is open for limited day-use access. There is currently no access to waterfalls, all camping is closed and skyline to sea trail is open to the north but access to south (towards the ocean) is closed\n\nThis may be the longest direct loop hike available in the peninsula. The nearly 30 mile loop covers three State Parks (Castle Rock, Big Basin, and Portola Redwoods), a county park (Pescadero Creek Park), and a Mid Peninsula Regional Open District (Long Ridge Open Space Preserve). This is all made possible by well positioned easements that allow for narrow but critical routes in between the parks. If you're looking for a good weekend hike that loops, this may be your best bet in the South Bay. \n\nCampsites: There are three nearly equidistant camp sites along the trail; Waterman Gap Trail Camp, Lane Trail Camp, Slate Creek Trail Campground. No matter where you start the hike, you will also have a campground within roughly 10 miles. Reservations are required in advance.\n\nParking: There are three overnight parking lots; at Big Basin Park HQ, Portola Redwoods Park HQ, and at the main Castle Rock entrance.  Parking at the latter will add a few miles distance. There are also several places where one could get dropped off and hop on the Skyline to Sea trail. \n\nHistorical Sites: There are two historical sites along the way, the Iverson Cabin and the Page Mill Site (original site of Mr. Page's Mill and road). There is not much to see at the sites except a marker and a sign, but it's nice to connect with some of the region's 19th century history.\n\nVariations: If you're looking for a longer route, you can extend this trail by pushing further into either Castle Rock, Big Basin, and even Pescadero Creek Park, as long as you make it to the easement cross points. Pushing further into these parks can easily help you come up with a 50-60 mile loop if you really wanted.\n\nTrail info for the parts encompassing:\n- Skyline to Sea: Good trail but proximity to highway 9 causes it to lose some of the isolation charm. Great views of redwoods though. Well trafficked popular trail.\n- Basin trail: The relatively higher elevation presents a very different vegetation, with shorter trees and more bushes, where one can capture some nice long distance views.\n- Basin trail easement: Second part of the trail felt like it didn't get a lot of foot traffic but was well marked and maintained. \n- Butano ridge trail: Sharp switchbacks take you down almost 1500 feet of elevation. Nice scenery. \n- Summit trail: Sounds like it would be a tough hike based on the name but it was only about a 600 foot elevation climb.\n- Slate creek trail: Well maintained and nice trail. Runs by a river for most of the distance.\n- Ward road trail: Connect Portola Redwoods state park to the Long Ridge Open Space Preserve... biggest elevation change of the entire trail here. Wide trail that really is more of a road. Something to get through, though there are some nice long views available.\n- Hicky Oaks Trail: Best long views of the entire hike here as one can see into the entire valley before re-connecting with the Skyline to the Sea trail. \n\nTrail is recommended only for experienced hikers. There are several rivers along the way to refill water, but it would be worth planning for those in advance as there are some long stretches with no river access. \n\nPlease post your trip reports and variations!"

The Ridge Trail, with moderate ascents and descents, runs north/south along the upper ridges of the park and offers sweeping views in all directions. \n\nThe scenic park is a refreshing escape from the urban sprawl below. Visit in the spring, when the green hills are covered in poppies.\n\nFor more information, see the Bay Area Ridge Trail page here: https://ridgetrail.org/vargas-plateau-regional-park/\n\nThis trail description is excerpted from the 2019 Guidebook.

The trail follows the gulch down to the parking area on the opposite side of the park.  The loop trail then heads up Purisima Creek.\n\nThe trail meets up with the Bay Area Ridge Trail, and turns back up the ridge. This trail heads through some more redwood groves, and the ocean views return when the trail meets up with Harkins Ridge Trail.\n\nThis is a slightly longer version of the popular Purisima Redwoods Open Space Preserve hike and starts on the eastern trailhead on the coastal side.  The trail begins at the point where 3 of the major tributaries of the Purisima Creek joins into one and continues its flow into the Pacific ocean.\n\nA major part of the hike is in the shades of redwoods. However, towards the latter part with elevation gain the trail opens out to give some good views of the ocean.

    "description": "This is a segment of the San Francisco Bay Trail: a 500 mile long mile trail around the Bay. This is the 1st section of the Bay Trail, taking hikers along the Northern Waterfront of San Francisco\n\nDid you know that nearly the entire San Francisco bayfront is manmade? Beneath your feet lie abandoned ships, excavated hilltops, rotting piers and rubble dumped into the bay after the 1906 earthquake and fire. Above, you will find one of the world's most inviting urban waterfronts. Beginning at iconic Fort Point under the Golden Gate Bridge, follow Marine Drive southeast along the water, passing the Warming Hut. A natural-surface trail hugs the shoreline through Crissy Field along restored wetlands and sand dunes. A paved path is available inland of the marsh along Mason Street. At the yacht harbor, follow the paved trail to the east and proceed as it meanders along the shoreline through Marina Green, or take the spur trail to the east and see if the eclectic wave organ will play for you. Climb the hill into Fort Mason, back down to equally historic Aquatic Park, and continue along the shoreline to Fisherman's Wharf. A gap in the Bay Trail at Fisherman's Wharf means there are no bicycle lanes between Hyde and Powell streets. Head east past Pier 39, follow The Embarcadero promenade along the shoreline and stop at Pier 7 for views of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge, Treasure Island and Yerba Buena Island. Pass the magnificent Ferry Building, take a trot out to the end of Pier 14, and continue south under the Bay Bridge. The path curves along the edge of South Beach Harbor and follows the shoreline around Oracle Park, home of the San Francisco Giants baseball team. Wathc an inning for free from the stadium's public viewing area. The northern bayfront, as well as the city's ocean shoreline, is almost entirely within the Golden Gate National Recreation Area, the first urban national park in the U.S. See segment #11 for Treasure and Yerba Buena islands.\n\nSide Trip: Bike into Sausalito over the Golden Gate Bridge, see the sights, and then take the ferry back to Pier 41 in San Francisco. To access the Fort Baker Bay Trail from the east sidewalk of the bridge, use the stairs from the Vista Point parking lot and cross under the span.\n\nWalking: Marina Green to Crissy Field, San Francisco\n\nAn approximately 2.5 mile walk (each way) from the foot of Fort Mason to the Warming Hut at Crissy Field. This flat shoreline walk features amazing views and both paved and natural surfaces.\n\nUrban: Marina Green Bay Trail, San Francisco\n\nOnly slightly less hectic than the Embarcadero, the Marina Green regularly hosts soccer, Frisbee, sporting and food events. Check out the beautiful boats in the marina, and the houses lining Marina Boulevard made famous by the Loma Prieta earthquake in 1989.\n\nHistory: San Francisco Maritime Historical Museum\n\nLocated in the Fisherman’s Wharf neighborhood, San Francisco Maritime National Historical Park offers the sights, sounds, smells and stories of Pacific Coast maritime history. At Hyde Street Pier, you can visit the Park’s historic ships, as well as boats from the Park’s small craft collection."

    "description": "According to Access Northern California (http://accessnca.org/access-northern-california/explore/explore-detail-view/?site_id=129): With 100 acres of bayside open space, Crissy Field is a delight for strollers, joggers, windsurfers, cyclists, dog walkers, and people looking to spot birds and even sea lions or dolphins. Spring is a good time to see many native wildflowers in bloom. You can mosey along the Golden Gate Promenade while admiring spectacular views of the Golden Gate Bridge and Strait. Check out the marsh, lagoon, and dune scrub, picnic, or sunbathe at the beach.\n\nThis is an easy paved and dirt trail with magnificent views of the SF Bay and Golden Gate Bridge while walking west and cityscape views on the return. Many consider this one of the most beautiful walks in SF. \n\nOriginally a rich salt marsh and gathering ground for native people, Crissy Field was later the landing site of Spanish explorers and traders from Russia, England, and Boston. In 1915, the Panama Pacific International Exposition was held here, and shortly after the area became one of the country's foremost military airfields and part of a U.S. Army post. With generous community support, Crissy Field has been transformed into a spectacular national parkland. The 100-acre site is included within the Golden Gate National Recreation Area and the Presidio of San Francisco. Along with the entire Presidio, it was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1962.\n\nAs part of the site restoration effort in 1998-2000, individuals and groups from schools, corporations, and civic organizations put in more than 100,000 native plants to help restore natural systems at Crissy Field. Community volunteers continue to play an important role in sustaining long-term stewardship of this national parkland.\n\nThe Palace of Fine Arts was originally constructed for the 1915 Panama-Pacific Exposition in order to exhibit works of art and is a beautiful area to explore. With its towering columns and domed rotunda, the building resembles those of Ancient Rome.\n\nAccessibility: There are at least 11 designated accessible spaces in the paved parking lot off of East Beach Road at the east end of the trail. All of them are van-accessible with striped access aisles. The trail surface is paved or a natural surface (dirt). It is typically at least 6 feet wide. The majority of the trail is estimated to be in the gentle (3% or less) grade category. This trail will likely be navigable for most wheelchairs/mobility equipment or stroller users. \n\nIf you intend to do the entire stretch, the best wheelchair access points are the East Beach parking lot (east end) or the Fort Point or Warming Hut lots (west end). From the East Beach parking lot, the broad, paved trail travels west along the beach. A beach wheelchair is available for loan at Fort Mason. To reserve, contact at least five days in advance by sending an email via the NPS website, or calling 415-561-4958; (800) 877-8339 Federal Relay Service, (877) 877-6280 VCO, (877) 877-8982 Speech to Speech, (800) 845-6136 Spanish, or (866) 893-8340 TeleBraille. Soon you come to a small trail that leads away from the bay and across the marsh on a wooden boardwalk. This protected wildlife area has easy-to-operate gates at both ends of the boardwalk. A spur trail leads down near the water's edge. Back on the main trail, you travel along the large lagoon. To your right, a number of wooden boardwalks extend toward the beach, with benches and space for several wheelchairs alongside. \n\nPast the lagoon, a large grassy field marks the site of the former airfield. You soon come to the Gulf of the Farallones National Marine Sanctuary Visitor Center, on your right. Follow the sidewalk to the main entrance, then wrap around the building to reach the ramp. If that entrance is locked, ring the buzzer (54 inches high). After the visitor center, you come to the West Bluffs picnic area, with several picnic tables and barbecue grills on concrete pads. The nearby Warming Hut has a small café and shop. Just west of the hut, you can roll out onto Torpedo Wharf (although the surface is very rough and cracked).\n\nPast the wharf, the trail to Fort Point is less appealing, as it becomes a sidewalk with a cross slope and then continues through a parking lot with no safe path of travel. Fortunately, there are often many pedestrians along this route and cars tend to move slowly. Here you are traveling right at the water's edge. At high tide and during storms, waves can splash the roadway along this stretch. After touring the fort, head back along the trail toward your starting point. There are accessible restrooms in the East Beach parking lot."

    "description": "According to Access Northern California (http://accessnca.org/access-northern-california/explore/explore-detail-view/?site_id=178): The Baylands Nature Preserve, said to be the largest salt marsh preserve on the Bay, encompasses nearly 2,000 acres protected for wildlife, including the endangered clapper rail and salt marsh harvest mouse. The preserve contains a duck pond (formerly a saltwater swimming pool); tidal and freshwater marshes; a sailing station for windsurfers and hand-carried, non-motorized boats; and almost 15 miles of trails, all of which have some wheelchair access. Although quite a few of the trails are along roads or in built-up areas, many are close to attractive sloughs where a wide variety of birds can be seen even without binoculars, and some are out in the marshlands, where a flock of sandpipers or a lonely blue heron may be your only company.\n\nJackrabbits are frequently seen in the restored wildlands above the high-water line, where gray foxes and burrowing owls are said to breed. But within the preserve you'll also find a sewage treatment plant, an airport, and a former landfill for the city of San Francisco, which is now a grassy garbage mountain named the Bixby Art Hill, home to several very understated pieces of public art. Highway 101 is nearby, as is Palo Alto's golf course.\n\nThe difficulty rating for this trail is based on the experience that a wheelchair or stroller user may have due to the gravel surface.\n\nVisitor center: A quarter-mile down the road from the duck pond is the Lucy Evans Baylands Nature Interpretive Center. Inside are displays about the wildlife you might see at the preserve and an ecology laboratory where visitors can prepare their own slides and examine them under microscopes. The microscopes are on a 25-inch-high shelf, but a video microscope that projects slides onto a monitor permits easier viewing. The center also offers videos, nature walks, and a variety of natural history programs for children and adults. On the wooden deck surrounding the nature center, use the low-mounted telescope to zoom in on shorebirds and waterfowl. A long boardwalk extending from the center across Harriet Mundy Marsh may be closed for major renovations. Located at 2775 Embarcadero Road, 650-329-2506.\n\nACCESSIBILITY: From the nature center you can head northwest on the San Francisquito Creek Trail, which leads out along a levee toward the Palo Alto Airport and the municipal golf course. The crushed-rock surface is dusty but firm in dry weather; during the rainy season parts of the trail may become impassable. The estimated grade is mostly gentle, all 5% or less.\n\nAbout 0.25 miles out, the surface becomes rough and small rocks slow your travel. Three-quarters of a mile farther, you will be near the north end of the airport runway. The trail climbs a short, moderate incline just before it turns inland along San Francisquito Creek. Past the airport, it intersects with the paved Baylands Bike Trail (still referred to as San Francisquito Creek Trail). Turn left and continue past the golf course for 0.5 miles to the Baylands Athletic Center and then turn around there.\n\nThere is designated accessible parking (van accessible), firm, and level or slope no greater than 2% at the Adobe Creek trailhead, where the one designated space is very likely to be occupied. Each of the several small lots along Embarcadero Rd. also has a van-accessible space, and at the sailing station, a gravel lot has several van-accessible spaces. Wheelchair-accessible restrooms with running water are at the nature center (open only when the center is) and Bixby Art Park parking area; porta-potties are at the duck pond and sailing station. Several accessible picnic tables are by the duck pond; all are near the parking lot on firm grass or dirt, and two have shortened benches to provide integrated seating for at least two wheelchairs each. The Visitor Center is wheelchair-accessible."

Battery Chamberlin, near the north end of the northern parking lot, is an artillery installation the U.S. Army maintained and frequently remodeled from the late 1800s through World War II. It still has a six-inch \"disappearing gun\" from the early 1900s, designed to pop up from behind a parapet to fire, then drop down again. The gun is revealed every weekend, weather permitting, and on the first full weekend of each month, from 11 am to 3 pm, park rangers demonstrate how it works. The approach from the parking lot is level but steps prevent close access to the installation.\n\nThe boardwalk begins near the southwestern edge of the parking lot and winds first south and then east through the dunes; it undulates as it follows the dune contours, but the slopes are gentle. Along the southern edge of the dunes, behind a fence and a tangle of coast live oaks, is Lobos Creek, the last free-flowing creek in San Francisco and the Presidio's main water source. For the most part it isn't visible from the trail, but you can often hear it as you follow its course eastward.\n\nThe northernmost end of Baker Beach is frequented by clothing-optional sunbathers.\n\nACCESSIBILITY: There are accessible parking spots and restrooms in both the north and south beachfront parking lots at Baker Beach. There are also two in the Lobos Creek Valley parking lot. About the first 0.3 miles of boardwalk to the overlook (take the spur trail to the left to reach it) is considered accessible. This section is typically at least four feet wide and mostly flat with a grade of 5% or less. The observation point has been marked with a waypoint on the map. Beyond that, the boardwalk continues but if you continue all the way to the staircase to the Bridge, users have reported there is not enough room to turn around. Also, the boardwalk sags in the middle or has shrubbery encroachment in places.\n\nThere is a wheelchair-accessible ramp leading from the Visitors Center up to the Bridge entrance with handrails and a gentle slope. Once on the Bridge, the path is paved, flat, and typically at least six feet wide. There is a safety barrier protecting pedestrians and cyclists from motor vehicle traffic on the Bridge. There is an additional wheelchair accessible bathroom with grab bars in a separate building across from the Visitor Center at the south end of the Bridge.\n\nBeach wheelchairs are available at Fort Mason if you reserve at least five days in advance and can transport one from there. An accessible bench sits in the northwest corner of the oceanfront parking lot and nearby, behind the restroom, a short path leads to a grassy area where picnic tables are set on pavement and dirt among cypress trees."

There is not much left of the 19th-century lime processing industry of the San Francisco Bay Area. Processing lime, a key ingredient in plaster and mortar, was big business in the California boom years after the Gold Rush. \n\nNew technology (namely Portland cement) made lime obsolete early in the 20th century, leaving the uncanny recuperative powers of the coast redwood to reclaim the forest where factories once stood. \n\nThe decaying lime kilns at Fall Creek Unit of Henry Cowell Redwoods State Park are about all that remains of the local industry.

    "description": "According to Access Northern California (http://accessnca.org/access-northern-california/explore/explore-detail-view/?site_id=138) If you are a Bay Area fisher, you probably already know about Pacifica Municipal Pier, a 1,140-foot open-ocean pier (41-inch railings). In season, people catch king salmon, surf perch, striped bass, and halibut. You can go out on the pier even if you don't fish. On the lawn near the pier are picnic tables and grills. A wide, paved promenade runs along the waterfront. North of the pier you can travel only a few blocks before the promenade ends, but the route is right at the ocean's edge, with waves crashing on rocks just below you in places. It can be a very dramatic—and wet—spot when the surf is high. Traveling south from the pier, you can extend your hike along a levee trail between Sharp Park Golf Course and the beach, then travel through wetlands on an elevated boardwalk.\n\nACCESSIBILITY: Two designated accessible parking spots are near the foot of the pier and two are at the end of Beach Blvd (that have a firm surface and 2% or less of cross slope). The wheelchair-accessible restroom at the pier has a very tight turn at the entry. An accessible vault toilet is at the Bradford Way trailhead. Only one of the several picnic tables along the paved promenade is reachable via a concrete pathway; the rest are surrounded by grass.\n\nThe route described here is a combination of pavement, boardwalk, and hard-packed dirt and gravel. Some sections may be sandy, while others may be muddy and rutted, with pools of standing water. For a smoother ride you can take the Old Mori Road Trail and bypass the rough levee trail that runs between the beach and Sharp Park Golf Course. From the pier, head south on the paved promenade that travels along Beach Boulevard for a few blocks, to Clarendon Road. From there, if you can manage a short but steep and sometimes sandy slope, you can access a hard-packed dirt and rock levee trail and continue south for another 0.5 miles to the end of the beach at Mori Point. The promenade can be a difficult ride because of windblown sand, standing rainwater, and bird droppings. The levee trail runs between the beach and Sharp Park Golf Course.\n\nAs you approach the point you will see Bootlegger Steps heading straight up the bluff. Before you reach them, the berm trail branches and one trail continues to the right, toward the stairs, while the left-hand trail (Old Mori Road) curves eastward. If you’re really adventurous, consider making a side trip along the stretch of Coastal Trail that takes off immediately past the trail to Bootlegger Steps, also on the right. It climbs steeply for a few hundred yards to the blufftop, where the ocean views are spectacular. Assistance may be needed for returning down the hill, as it can be slippery.\n\nBack on Old Mori Road trail, continue to an elevated wooden boardwalk that travels through wetlands south of Laguna Salada, the lake inside the golf course grounds. The wetlands provide habitat for the endangered red-legged frog and San Francisco garter snake. Wood benches and interpretive signs are here and there along the boardwalk. Past the wetlands, the boardwalk ends and a broad, hard-packed dirt and gravel trail continues along the old roadway. A tall wood fence fronts the northern side of the trail, blocking it from the houses along the route. The level path travels through trees and past a marshy creek; standing water and mud can be a problem here during the rainy season.\n\nThe trail ends at Bradford Way and Mori Point Road, but if you want to extend your hike, you can follow Mori Point Road to the right (you must travel in the roadway a short distance, but traffic is typically light and slow-moving) to connect to the Pacifica Coastal Trail, which travels south along Highway One through the Calera Creek wetlands and on to Rockaway Beach and Pacifica State Beach (about three miles). The entire stretch from Sharp Park to Pacifica State Beach is about seven miles one way."

    "description": "The Baylands Nature Preserve, said to be the largest salt marsh preserve on the Bay, encompasses nearly 2,000 acres protected for wildlife, including the endangered clapper rail and salt marsh harvest mouse. The preserve contains a duck pond (formerly a saltwater swimming pool); tidal and freshwater marshes; a sailing station for windsurfers and hand-carried, non-motorized boats; and almost 15 miles of trails, all of which have some wheelchair access. Although quite a few of the trails are along roads or in built-up areas, many are close to attractive sloughs where a wide variety of birds can be seen even without binoculars, and some are out in the marshlands, where a flock of sandpipers or a lonely blue heron may be your only company.\n\nJackrabbits are frequently seen in the restored wildlands above the high-water line, where gray foxes and burrowing owls are said to breed. But within the preserve you'll also find a sewage treatment plant, an airport, and a former landfill for the city of San Francisco, which is now a grassy garbage mountain named the Bixby Art Hill, home to several very understated pieces of public art. Highway 101 is nearby, as is Palo Alto's golf course.\n\nThe difficulty rating for this trail is based on the experience that a wheelchair or stroller user may have due to the gravel surface.\n\nVisitor center: A quarter-mile down the road from the duck pond is the Lucy Evans Baylands Nature Interpretive Center. Inside are displays about the wildlife you might see at the preserve and an ecology laboratory where visitors can prepare their own slides and examine them under microscopes. The microscopes are on a 25-inch-high shelf, but a video microscope that projects slides onto a monitor permits easier viewing. The center also offers videos, nature walks, and a variety of natural history programs for children and adults. On the wooden deck surrounding the nature center, use the low-mounted telescope to zoom in on shorebirds and waterfowl. A long boardwalk extending from the center across Harriet Mundy Marsh may be closed for major renovations. Located at 2775 Embarcadero Road, 650-329-2506.\n\nACCESSIBILITY: This is a nice trail--actually an unpaved service road on a levee--offering choice birdwatching over nearly 3 miles, with sloughs on both sides and a great sense of peaceful isolation, far from human activity. However, the uneven surface makes the 6 miles out and back rough riding in a wheelchair. The estimated slope is gentle though, all 3% or less. \n\nThe best birdwatching is along the mile-long section between Charleston Slough and Adobe Creek, just before the trail reaches Shoreline Park, so if the distance seems too great, starting from there may be a good choice. Consider the weather when planning a visit: There is no shade, but breezes off the water may be chilly. Also take tides into account; you'll see a lot of mud at low tide, but wading birds will be active then. Plenty of benches are provided.\n\nThere is designated accessible parking (van accessible), firm, and level or slope no greater than 2% at the Adobe Creek trailhead, where the one designated space is very likely to be occupied. Each of the several small lots along Embarcadero Rd. also has a van-accessible space, and at the sailing station, a gravel lot has several van-accessible spaces. Wheelchair-accessible restrooms with running water are at the nature center (open only when the center is) and Bixby Art Park parking area; porta-potties are at the duck pond and sailing station. Several accessible picnic tables are by the duck pond; all are near the parking lot on firm grass or dirt, and two have shortened benches to provide integrated seating for at least two wheelchairs each. The Visitor Center is wheelchair-accessible."

    "description": "According to Access Northern California (http://accessnca.org/access-northern-california/explore/explore-detail-view/?site_id=156): The Bay Trail skirts the eastern perimeter of the park, parallel to Coyote Point Drive for much of the way. Starting near the Peninsula Humane Society shelter on Airport Boulevard, you quickly leave the Bay views behind, turning inland to travel past many of the park's amenities. Across Coyote Point Drive is the Poplar Creek Golf Course.\n\nApproximately a half-mile in, a grove of eucalyptus trees atop a nearby hill wafts a sweet aroma into the air and, depending on the time of day, provides a little shade. The Bay Trail briefly touches Coyote Point Marina, then travels south out of the park for 2.5 miles to the San Mateo Bridge. No matter where you are on the trail, you can hear planes circling to land at nearby San Francisco International Airport and shots ringing from the shooting range, but the sounds of songbirds and other small animals provide a calming balance to the manmade racket.\n\nCoyote Point was once an island separated from the mainland by a large salt marsh that was later filled in. Much of the 670-acre park is flat, except for a few knolls among eucalyptus trees that often reveal scenic overlooks of the marina, the remaining marsh, and the Bay. With an outstanding nature museum, several playgrounds, plentiful picnic areas, a beach, large lawns, and an accessible playground at the Eucalyptus Recreation Area, the park makes a great day-long outing for families. Adults can also enjoy a shooting range, marina, yacht club (not wheelchair accessible), and fishing jetty.\n\nSituated on the east side of a tree-shaded knoll in the eastern part of the park, the CuriOdyssey Museum is a top-notch interactive science and education center that allows visitors to observe a variety of native California animals up close. Indoor exhibits include interactive displays, computer activities, videos, and films about Bay Area ecosystems. The open floor plan makes it easy to maneuver. In the outdoor animal habitats you can learn about and get close to various reptiles, amphibians, mammals, and, in the walk-through aviary, nearly two dozen native birds. The butterfly and hummingbird gardens are scenic and peaceful spots in which to rest and watch the wildlife.\n\nACCESSIBILITY: There is firm, designated accessible parking with a slope no greater than 2% at the marina, trailheads, promenade, museum, and playground. The trail surface is paved asphalt and it is typically at least six feet wide. It is mostly gentle, all estimated to be 5% or less. Most wheelchair and stroller users will find this trail navigable.\n\nThe restrooms in the park are partially accessible (most only allow front-transfers, are too shallow to close the stall door, and have no grab bars on the back wall). The most accessible one is by the drop-in picnic area below the museum, which has enough clearance for closing the stall door and pulling alongside the toilet. Numerous picnic areas have accessible tables with a firm and stable path and surface, and at least 27 inches of knee clearance. The most accessible tables are downhill from the CuriOdessey Museum."

    "description": "Park Features: Bishop Ranch is a serene parkland located on 806 acres in San Ramon. Watch for deer, red-tailed hawks, and turkey vultures while you enjoy lovely views of open skies and Mount Diablo to the northeast. Hiking, jogging, kite flying, dog walking, and picnicking are some of the activities to be enjoyed on this ridgetop refuge.\n\nTrail Highlights: The seasonal creek is active in the winter months and into spring, depending on rainfall. Enjoy the pleasant groves of oak trees sprawling throughout the park. Delight in views of the San Ramon, Dublin, and Pleasanton valleys, with Mount Diablo as the backdrop. There are no restroom facilities, so plan ahead.\n\nTrail Directions: Begin southwest on Grey Fox Trail. Walk .06 miles and take the first right onto Stream View Trail. The trail splits off around the bottom of the seasonal creek: keep to the path left/southwest of the creek (though either route will lead back to the same trail). There is a brief uphill section before the hiker-only section of the Stream View meets the wider multi-use section of Stream View. Take a right at that junction and continue along Stream View above and parallel to the creek. The last section of Stream View Trail heads steeply uphill, away from the creek, gaining an elevation of about 400 feet. Atop this small hill, *turn left onto Redtail Hawk Trail. Follow the trail for .18 miles, turning left onto Grey Fox Trail to finish the loop. This final stretch of the hike will take you back to the start and grace you with sweeping views of Mount Diablo to the northeast.\n\n*If you would like to extend your hike, turn right onto Redtail Hawk Trail. This is an out-and-back hike which adds 1.48 miles total to your hike.\n\nPark Curfew/Hours: 5 a.m. to 10 p.m."

    "description": "According to Access Northern CA (http://accessnca.org/access-northern-california/explore/explore-detail-view/?site_id=40): This paved trail along Alameda Creek from Niles Canyon to the bay attracts bicyclists, skaters, runners, and equestrians.  It will lead you west a couple of miles out into the salt flats at the Bay, or east following Alameda Creek to its source ten-miles away in Niles Canyon. At Niles Staging Area, the creek runs over a rocky bed and people picnic or fish (not accessible pier) from willow-shaded banks.\n\nThe trail is accessible from several thoroughfares in the Fremont, Union City and Newark areas. Motor vehicles are not allowed on the trail.\n\nFor the first four miles heading east, there's no shade or facilities until you reach the Beard Staging Area. Following the creek downstream on the southern trail, you pass under Mission Blvd. and, 0.75 miles further, pass the Alameda County Water District’s three rubber cofferdams. Inflated year-round except during storms, these dams transform the creek into a series of long ponds. In the dry season, they reduce the creek’s flow to a trickle, leaving the exposed streambed covered with cattails. You'll pass residential areas and some sections are partially shaded by locust, pepper, pine, and eucalyptus trees.\n\nThe trail on the south bank provides access to Coyote Hills Regional Park. An additional 3.5 mile loop trail making the run west from Niles Canyon along the trail, through Coyote Hills and back again, qualifies in distance for marathon runs. For those who want to clock shorter distances along the trail, markers have been installed at quarter-mile intervals.\n\nACCESSIBILITY: There is designated, van-accessible parking at the Isherwood, Niles, and Beard staging areas. Sequoia Bridge spans the creek 2.25 miles from Niles Staging Area, providing access to the northern trail and Isherwood Staging Area. If you choose to start your trip from this staging area, it’s best to head upstream to Sequoia Bridge and cross to the southern trail before heading west. The automobile bridge on Isherwood Way has no curb cuts, and the surface of the northern trail makes for a very bumpy wheelchair ride. Continuing on the southern trail, you pass residential backyards for the next two miles before coming to the Beard Staging Area, the last stopping place with amenities before you reach Coyote Hills Regional Park another four miles down the trail. \n\nThe trail has a paved surface and is typically at least four feet wide. It is estimated to be gentle, all 3% or less in grade. Wherever the trail passes under a road, there are steep slopes that may be challenging for manual wheelchair users. \n\nThere are accessible picnic tables at the Beard Staging area with firm & stable path to tables, firm and stable table surfaces, and 27 inches or greater knee clearance."

For more information, please visit https://parks.sccgov.org/sites/g/files/exjcpb961/files/documents/ShorelineProject2024Updates.pdf\n\nAccording to Access Northern California (http://accessnca.org/access-northern-california/explore/explore-detail-view/?site_id=173): The Don Edwards San Francisco Bay National Wildlife Refuge, the first and largest urban national wildlife refuge in the United States, is just one piece of the larger San Francisco Bay National Wildlife Refuge Complex. Encompassing 30,000 acres, the Don Edwards refuge consists primarily of tidal marsh, salt ponds, mudflats, and seasonal wetlands. Public entry points for visiting Don Edwards are at its headquarters (at the refuge's north end in Fremont) and at this site, which is around the southern tip of San Francisco Bay. The refuge encompasses thousands of acres of restored wetlands, and it is a very fine place to see waterfowl. It's also scenic, with interesting shrubbery along the marshes and wide expanses of blue water, as well as ponds in various shades of yellow and red because of the salt-tolerant microorganisms that flourish where the tide is excluded.\n\nThe trails in the Alviso section of the refuge are almost entirely wheelchair accessible since most run atop level levees that double as maintenance roads. Not many people come here, with the exception of school groups and birdwatchers. The Mallard Slough Loop is closed during hunting season, late October to late January. If you want to do the loop in its entirety, be prepared for a day-long outing and a variety of weather conditions along this exposed part of the Bay shoreline.\n\nThe Environmental Education Center has displays on the South Bay’s ecology and history, a small bookstore, and replicas of the reed boats and shelters used by the native people. It is used for school programs and other events on weekdays and is open to the public on weekends. The entry door is rather heavy. The visitor center area closes at 4 PM, so please be cautious if you use their parking lot. There is limited parking available just outside of the gated road, which is the start/end point shown on the map for this trail loop. If you have any concerns about the gate closure it may be best to park just outside.\n\nACCESSIBILITY: There are firm, designated accessible parking spaces with a 2% slope or less behind the education center. When the lot is closed, nose-in parking is permitted outside the gate on a wide, hard gravel strip along the road, but it has no designated accessible spaces. The trail surface is dirt/gravel and it is typically at least four feet wide. It is estimated to have a gentle grade (all 3% or less).\n\nThe connector trail from the education center to the Mallard Slough Trail is a bit steep, slightly exceeding a 5% grade in places. The connector trail from the education center is less than 4 feet wide. Firm (hardened soil) for most of the loop. Some spots are uncomfortably soft. It can be bumpy - a manual chair user will need to be strong and may need assistance, especially on the spur which has more gravel. From the education center, you can take a boardwalk to the 5.5-mile Mallard Slough Loop Trail, a gravel and dirt levee path. Following the loop clockwise from the boardwalk, the going gets tougher about two miles out - here the dirt surface becomes more uneven, with large gravel and some soft spots.\n\nA half-mile spur trail extends from the northernmost point of this loop to Coyote Creek; the surface is soft, making travel difficult compared to the main trail, but it may be worth the trouble since the spur takes you to the site of Drawbridge, a small town that flourished in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. There's little left to see of it now, but stop in at the Education Center to look at photos and learn about its history.\n\nAs you round the halfway point and head back, traveling should become a little easier. The visitor center is wheelchair accessible. There are accessible restrooms inside the Environmental Education Center but the restroom doors are heavy. There is an accessible porta-potty is in the parking lot near the accessible space. Partially accessible picnic tables are across the parking lot from the Environmental Education Center in a covered open-air pavilion. There isn't enough space at the end of the tables for most wheelchairs to pull under them. Another table is just off the New Chicago Marsh Trail, but is down a steep path on a soft surface and is not accessible without a lot of help."

You'll also descend along the Madrone Soda Springs Trail and the Mile Trail, which passes the decaying remains of an era when the springs were a major tourist attraction. \n\nBest time to go: spring, when the hills are green and the wildflowers are popping, and early summer, when it's warm enough to swim at China Hole.

Starting at the Grant Lake Trailhead, cut right down a ravine and then make a left at the McCreery Lake trail. Then at the junction of the Los Huecos and Hall's Valley trails, follow Hall's Valley. If you're a glutton for punishment, you could take the Los Huecos trail, but Hall's Valley is punishment enough for most.\n\nIt's two miles up hill and mostly through oak forests and woodlands. At the top, you start to get views of the surrounding hills and mountains and even a glimpse of the San Francisco Bay. The trail Tees into the Canada de Pala trail at the top. Make a left and continue going up. This part of the trail is oak savanna, and you start to get sweeping vistas of the surrounding countryside. You'll come to the Pala Seca Trail; both ends of it. Take the left branch (down for once) and continue until you get to the bottom of the Washburn trail. This area is known as Deer Valley and is rather unique because there is actual running water in places even late in the year.  \n\nThe Washburn trail is more up for the first half a mile or so. Keep an eye out for the golden eagles that roost on a tree overlooking the valley near the top. There's a bench at the top that affords one of the best vistas in the park. Sit down and enjoy the view for a minute or two. You've done the hard physical work, now it's time for the mental gymnastics.  \n\nThe trail down is steep, rough, and serpentine. Take it pretty slow and it is still a hard. The bottom is actually lower than the trailhead, and there's a 300 foot climb before you glide down to the trail's junction with Mt Hamilton Road. A mile on the pavement and you're back where you started. What a ride!"

    "description": "Trail Highlights: The San Francisco Bay trail loop is mostly paved except for the last half mile, which is hard gravel and dirt with some moderate slopes. The rest of the trail is mainly flat and great for people using mobility devices and/or strollers, dog walkers, and cycling. It is only half-mile to reach the shoreline where you can stroll along and soak up the sun and enjoy breezes from San Leandro Bay. There are many benches along the way but little shade, except by the picnic tables. The only accessible vault toilet is about a quarter-mile in, on the right. Trail width is 4 feet and above.\n\nPark Features: An astonishing diversity of wildlife can be seen at this shoreline park even though it is still under development. Northern harriers, white-tailed kites, red-tailed hawks, and shorebirds abound. Views of the Bay are spectacular. Some new amenities include an 18-hole disc golf course and a quarter-acre garden with 300 plants that flower from fall through winter, providing overwintering Monarchs with nectar to help them survive the winter and migrate in spring. Come with friends and family to enjoy a game of disc golf or picnic at one of the seven group picnic areas (non-reservable).\n\nTrail Directions: From the staging area at the end of Neptune Drive, go through the entrance gate and turn left onto the paved San Francisco Bay Trail. This trail soon reaches the water. Follow the paved trail all along the park’s perimeter. At the far end of the park, make a sharp right turn at the end of the pavement, and then, in a quarter-mile, a left onto Oyster Bay Loop Trail to complete the loop. Please use caution: there may be construction trucks in the park.\n\nAccording to Access Northern California (http://accessnca.org/access-northern-california/explore/explore-detail-view/?site_id=152): There is plentiful street parking on Neptune Drive but vans with lifts or ramps should park on the west side of the street, where there is a sidewalk. A wheelchair-accessible vault toilet is at the first trail junction, up the hill by the picnic area. There is no sink. Picnic tables near the bathroom are very high, including one that has no benches attached. More are scattered along the inland trail to the Rising Wave sculpture. From the trailhead, you climb a long, gentle hill for several hundred yards to a fork. The inland trails have some slopes that may be greater than 5% (a typical ramp slope). From there you can veer right and travel uphill to a picnic area, where a dirt trail travels inland, or continue on the smoother paved shoreline trail. The shoreline trail continues to wrap around the hillside to a spur that takes you to Roger Berry’s metal sculpture “Rising Wave.” This is a good place to enjoy views of the Bay, San Leandro Marina, and the airport’s control tower. You’ll need to retrace your route to reconnect to the perimeter trail; the other dirt trails from here are too steep to navigate in a wheelchair. The trail curves inland toward a small bay that separates the park peninsula from the airport. You’ll soon come to the Bill Lockyer Bridge (railings are 54” high but are slatted so you can see through them), which crosses the San Leandro Slough and travels a half-mile past a golf course to dead-end at the new BART station for the Oakland Airport. The noise from the trains will likely be very loud. The Bay Trail then travels in either direction, parallel to Airport Drive. The stretch from the bridge to the dead end seemed to be more of a connector route for cyclists than an enjoyable extension of the shoreline trail. If you continue on the perimeter trail instead of crossing the bridge, it ends a few hundred yards at a gravel road which is very bumpy. Once you get past the initial uphill stretch, the perimeter trail is level.\n\nAccessibility: This trail is likely accessible with assistance for visitors using wheelchairs, mobility equipment, or strollers or visitors may need to avoid the steeper or unpaved sections for safety. \n\nAccessible Parking:\nParking lot surface: paved street parking.\nThere do not appear to be any designated accessible parking spaces within 1.0 miles of the trailhead.\n\nTrail Details:\nTrail surface: paved asphalt, gravel, a natural surface (dirt);\nAverage trail width: 6 feet;\nEstimated average grade category: mostly gentle (5% or less) with steeper sections at about 1.7 and 2.1 miles when going clockwise."

When marsh restoration work took place here to help improve the habitat for the endangered San Francisco garter snake and the threatened red-legged frog, it also lead to the creation of an accessible level trail that stretches to the ocean. The network of other trails that course through the park mostly climb a gentle to moderate slope over bumpy terrain–manageable in a motorized wheelchair except for a very steep section that leads to the point. The park is bounded by Laguna Salada Marsh and Sharp Park Municipal Golf Course to the north; by Sweeney Ridge to the east; and by the Calera Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant to the south.\n\nACCESSIBILITY: There two are designated accessible parking spaces at the start of the trail in the Mori Point parking lot. There is also a wheelchair-accessible bathroom. The Old Mori Trail is basically a linear path to the ocean. The surface is asphalt or boardwalk and typically at least four feet wide. The estimated grade is mostly gentle (all 6% or less).\n\nYou’ll start out following alongside some housing but a tall wood fence blocks your view of it. After less than a half-mile you come to Lishumsha Trail on your left. This trail travels closer to the bluffs and in less than a quarter-mile rejoins Old Mori Trail by the ocean; it is more challenging but the views are worth the effort. \n\nIf you stay on Old Mori you can meander around a native plant garden then cross a marsh on a boardwalk. Once at the ocean you can continue uphill to a levee trail that separates Sharp Park Golf Course from the ocean. From this elevated vantage point, you may spot pelicans skimming the water, shorebirds probing the sand and occasionally, sea lions. To the south another 0.5 miles is Pacifica Pier. Although this route requires careful navigation around the ruts and is quite bumpy, the sweeping views are worth the effort.\n\nTo extend your visit you could also connect via a sidewalk along Hwy 1 a short distance, to Calera Creek Trail. This paved 0.75 mile trail runs through restored wetlands to Rockaway Beach."

    "description": "According to Access Northern California (http://accessnca.org/access-northern-california/explore/explore-detail-view/?site_id=91): Half Moon Bay, the oldest town in San Mateo County, lies along a gently curving, sandy shore that is protected as parkland. Stretching for nearly four miles north to south is Half Moon Bay State Beach, a wide expanse of beach and bluff that includes four beaches: Venice, Roosevelt, Dunes, and Francis, the most wheelchair accessible and most developed. Amenities at Francis Beach include blufftop camping, blufftop picnic tables overlooking the beach, and a small visitor center with displays about local wildflowers, birds, and animals, as well as local history. Beach access for a beach wheelchair is at Roosevelt and Francis Beaches (at the northwest corner of each).\n\nThe paved Coastside Trail runs for nearly 3.5 miles behind the beaches, from Mirada Road, one mile south of Pillar Point Harbor, to Poplar Street, 0.5 miles south of Francis Beach. Numerous benches along the trail offer unobstructed ocean views.\n\nThis heavily used multi-use trail runs along the eastern boundary of Half Moon Bay State Beach and provides good pedestrian access to all four beaches in the system, as well as the city-owned Poplar Beach, south of Francis Beach. The ocean is not always visible, but when it is you can see the crescent shape of the coastline that gives Half Moon Bay its name. For a lovely outing, you can combine this walk with a meal at one of several trailside cafes at the trail's north end by Magellan Road.\n\nA horse trail parallels the Coastside Trail between Roosevelt and Francis Beaches. The park is open from 8 AM to sunset daily and there is a parking fee.\n\nAccessibility: The route is accessible from any of the Half Moon Bay State Beaches and from Poplar Beach and there is plentiful firm accessible parking in any of the beach lots. There are wheelchair accessible bathrooms at Venice, Roosevelt, Dunes, and Francis Beaches and a porta-potty is in the Poplar Beach parking lot. A beach wheelchair is available for loan at the Francis Beach entry kiosk on a first-come, first-served basis. Chairs can be taken to the other beaches using your own vehicle. There are firm and stable accessible picnic tables with at least 27 inches of knee clearance at Francis and Roosevelt Beaches and along the Coastside Trail just north of Venice Beach.\n\nThe trail is paved, typically at least four feet wide, and mostly gentle (estimated 5% grade or less). From Poplar Beach, head south from the parking lot one-quarter mile to a bridge that crosses an outlet to the ocean. On the other side of the bridge, after passing through a small stand of cypress trees, the trail becomes hard-packed dirt and is very rutted. A sign indicates that this blufftop is Wavecrest, a 206-acre park set aside in part to serve as raptor wintering grounds. Although the terrain is very rough and not wheelchair accessible past 20 feet, the views are spectacular—plus, you might spot migrating whales (Nov.-Jan.) and raptors. Retrace your steps and continue north past Poplar Road - check out the view from the bluff at the foot of Poplar.\n\nYou will reach Francis Beach in about 0.8 miles, then cross the park entry road to continue along the trail, unless you want to stop in at the small visitor center (weekends only) or picnic on the bluffs. A sign indicates it is another 2.4 miles to the trail's end. The trail parallels the campground access road a short distance, then, once past the developed area, becomes quieter.\n\nNext, you will cross Pilarcitos Creek on a long wooden bridge that's pretty bumpy. Housing is now closer to the trail and scrub obscures the ocean. Soon you will arrive at Venice Beach, where there is no wheelchair access to the beach. Continuing north a few hundred yards there is another extremely bumpy bridge. After crossing this, the trail briefly curves west and a picnic area comes into view, as does the ocean.\n\nAbout 1.6 miles from Francis Beach you will arrive at Dunes Beach, then Roosevelt Beach. Beyond Roosevelt Beach, the surroundings are more residential. At Mirada Road, it may appear as if the trail ends, but continuing on traffic is sparse and moves slowly because of all the people. In a quarter of a mile, you will reach Magellan Avenue and can follow it a few hundred feet to another trailhead. This new trail travels on the bluffs through Mirada Surf, a 49-acre park that occupies one of the few remaining undeveloped coastal bluffs in the region. Signage indicates that it travels one-third of a mile north to Pillar Point Harbor."

For more information, please visit https://www.ebparks.org/parks/leona-canyon \n\nPark Features: Nestled between hillside neighborhoods and Merritt College, Leona Canyon offers a 290-acre sanctuary to those seeking a quick and easy escape into nature. Dog owners and walkers alike adore this park due to its accessible location. With lush groves of trees hanging over the trails and creekside terraces, this park provides just the right amount of space to take a break from your day and breathe some fresh air. There are no developed facilities here and no water provided. Restrooms are available at Merritt College during class hours. Water and restrooms are also located at the Anthony Chabot Equestrian Center, 14600 Skyline Blvd. Park maps and a self-guided trail map titled “Local Indian Uses of Plants” are available at the Leona Canyon trailhead.\n\nTrail Highlights: This route is “easy to moderate” because you can decrease\nthe distance to make it an easier challenge since it is not a loop trail. The entire hike is 4.28 miles, but you could skip the Pyrite Trail (which is steep and has some storm damage) and make this hike 2.68 miles instead. Halfway up, when the Pyrite Trail hooks right and levels out, you will find two clearings on the left that offer peaceful terraces for resting with overlooks of Leona Canyon. Whether you choose to take the Pyrite Trail or prefer an easier hike by staying on the Leona Trail, it is important to know that both trails are out-and-back routes – just retrace your steps to get back to the parking lot.\n\nTrail Directions: This trail begins at Leona Canyon’s parking lot below Campus Drive. Enter the park and stay on the upper trail to the right to begin Leona Trail. Hike 1.34 miles until you reach the end of the trail at Merritt College. Turn around and hike .61 miles back to find the Pyrite Trail on your right. Take a right to begin the steep, but short, trail, which is .80 miles one way. Once you reach the EBRPD gate marking the park boundary line at the end of the trail, turn around to retrace your steps back to Leona Trail. Turn right here and make your way back to the parking lot.\n\nAccess is also available at Merritt College. The lot charges a fee and is unavailable on weekends. AC Transit #54 serves Merritt College weekdays only.\n\nPark Curfew/Hours: 5 a.m. to 10 p.m. \n\nFees: None\n\nWebsite: www.ebparks.org/parks/leona"

There are several trail heads that access the park, including the Canyon Meadow Staging Area, Skyline Gate Staging Area, and the Redwood Gate Staging Area. Popular trails in the park include the East Ridge Trail and West Ridge Trail, which allow bikes, the stream trail, and the French Trail. The park has four picnic sites, several group overnight camping areas, and a children's play structure off of the Stream Trail from the Canyon Meadow staging area. The Chabot Space and Science Center is also located within the park. Redwood Regional Park is great for nature watching.

As you move up towards the headwaters, the valley changes from cool and mossy to slightly drier forest, finally reaching one of the few lakes in the Santa Cruz Mountains, a man-made reservoir. The trail goes across the dam (and borders private property, please be respectful).\n\nLeaving the lake, you climb up some switchbacks eventually reaching the preserve's namesake Long Ridge with open views to the southwest, towards some of the biggest redwood parks of the Santa Cruz Mountains. Soon you reach a granite bench dedicated to Wallace Stegner, the Stanford author and conservationist who played an important role in helping save many of these lands from development. In early spring the hillsides can be covered in a profusion of wildflowers.\n\nJust after the bench, the trail forks, one fork seemingly leading along the ridgeline and the other dropping into the forest. The ridgeline trail only goes about 50 yards before running into a 'private property' sign and a fence, so down into the forest you go. From here you wind down towards your start; reaching a 4-way intersection in the middle of the forest. This route goes forward across the intersection, but you can also do a switchback heading down towards the Peters Creek Trail here.\n\nWander through the quiet forest until a descent drops you back to Peters Creek, and a short ascent back to the noise and bustle of Highway 35."

    "description": "Candlestick Point: A study in recovery, and urban retreat. At the easily accessible Candlestick Point State Recreational Area, visitors can enjoy panoramic views of the San Francisco Bay, the East Bay Hills, San Bruno Mountain, and downtown San Francisco. \n\nThe entire trip is kid-friendly and on a combination of both paved and well-graded dirt paths. Along the parking areas are a number of access points.\n\nThere are several unique features to this park. For one, it's very easy to get to. It's also an experiment in urban recovery. The park is generally on contoured landfills, mounds and vegetation seem designed to provide a wide variety of scenic vignettes, and it's an interesting fusion of grasslands, wetlands, beaches, lawns, and fishing piers, with just a smattering of remnant industrial remains. The landscape makes it easy to forget you're in a former industrial zone yet in the background there's Candlestick Park and Hunters Point Shipyard, making for an interesting contrast. \n\nBring along some snacks and pack something warm and wind-resistant, just in case. The park offers a retreat from metropolitan congestion and the opportunity to relax in the peaceful scenery. The location on the shoreline of San Francisco Bay provides a variety of recreational opportunities that include windsurfing, fishing, bird watching, cycling, roller-blading, walking, and picnicking. Individual and group picnic sites, as well as fishing piers and other outdoor activities not easily available in the city, offer a get-away of open space. \n\nCandlestick Point SRA was the first state park in California developed to bring state park values into the urban setting. Several stories are told of where the point got its name. \n\nThe earliest reference dates from the Spanish DeAnza expedition in 1781 noting a candlestick-shaped rock pinnacle on the point. The point was also referenced in a U.S. Geodetic Survey in 1869. The rock disappeared around 1920.\n\nThe more romantic story is that the area was used to burn old and abandoned ships during the early settlers' days. When the wooden ships were burned off the point, the last part sinking into the water resembled a candlestick. \n\nAnother story is that the point was a local hunting ground named after the candlestick bird, the chicken-sized long-billed Curlew known for its delicious meat that was nearly hunted to extinction by the 1950s.\n\nDuring World War II, Candlestick Point was expanded by 170 acres of fill into the San Francisco Bay to build a shipyard for the Pacific War effort. After the war, the landfill remained and became both a local sewer and garbage dump. Shortly after, the football stadium was built in an effort to halt the blight and move the New York Giants to San Francisco.\n\nOn the bayside of the stadium grounds, the abandoned fill sat without purpose but in 1977, the California Legislature voted to develop the land as a state park -- the first urban state recreation area.\n\nAccessibility: There are 4 designated accessible spaces in the paved parking lot off of Donnor Avenue at the west end of the trail. All of them are van-accessible with striped access aisles. The trail surface is paved asphalt or gravel. It is typically at least 6 feet wide. \n\nThe whole trail is estimated to be in the gentle (3% or less) grade category. Trail goers using wheelchairs/mobility equipment or strollers may need assistance in the gravel sections or to avoid them for safety after rain. It is easy to stay on the asphalt paths. There are benches and picnic tables along the route for resting."

You will occasionally see the Sierra Azul and the tall peaks of the Santa Cruz Mountains. As you continue, the trail drops into the valley. \n\nYou will reach the old Mine Hill Furnace remains. This section of the trail winds across hills, with sporadic views of deer. After passing the furnace, the trail ascends a steep hill to reach the Castillero Trail. This last stretch features a steep climb from the mining furnace site and a broad vista."

    "description": "According to Access Northern California (http://accessnca.org/access-northern-california/explore/explore-detail-view/?site_id=178): The Baylands Nature Preserve, said to be the largest salt marsh preserve on the Bay, encompasses nearly 2,000 acres protected for wildlife, including the endangered clapper rail and salt marsh harvest mouse. The preserve contains a duck pond (formerly a saltwater swimming pool); tidal and freshwater marshes; a sailing station for windsurfers and hand-carried, non-motorized boats; and almost 15 miles of trails, all of which have some wheelchair access. Although quite a few of the trails are along roads or in built-up areas, many are close to attractive sloughs where a wide variety of birds can be seen even without binoculars, and some are out in the marshlands, where a flock of sandpipers or a lonely blue heron may be your only company.\n\nJackrabbits are frequently seen in the restored wildlands above the high-water line, where gray foxes and burrowing owls are said to breed. But within the preserve you'll also find a sewage treatment plant, an airport, and a former landfill for the city of San Francisco, which is now a grassy garbage mountain named the Bixby Art Hill, home to several very understated pieces of public art. Highway 101 is nearby, as is Palo Alto's golf course.\n\nThe difficulty rating for this trail is based on the experience that a wheelchair or stroller user may have due to the gravel surface.\n\nVisitor center: A quarter-mile down the road from the duck pond is the Lucy Evans Baylands Nature Interpretive Center. Inside are displays about the wildlife you might see at the preserve and an ecology laboratory where visitors can prepare their own slides and examine them under microscopes. The microscopes are on a 25-inch-high shelf, but a video microscope that projects slides onto a monitor permits easier viewing. The center also offers videos, nature walks, and a variety of natural history programs for children and adults. On the wooden deck surrounding the nature center, use the low-mounted telescope to zoom in on shorebirds and waterfowl. A long boardwalk extending from the center across Harriet Mundy Marsh may be closed for major renovations. Located at 2775 Embarcadero Road, 650-329-2506.\n\nACCESSIBILITY: This maze of trails, artistically surfaced with oyster shells, meanders over the garbage mountain; all are considerably steeper than 5% grade (up to 12% in some places) but may be manageable in a strong power chair. In addition to the sense of accomplishment, if you make it to the top, you can get a closer look at the art pieces installed by landscape architects.\n\nThere is designated accessible parking (van accessible), firm, and level or slope no greater than 2% at the Adobe Creek trailhead, where the one designated space is very likely to be occupied. Each of the several small lots along Embarcadero Rd. also has a van-accessible space, and at the sailing station, a gravel lot has several van-accessible spaces. Wheelchair-accessible restrooms with running water are at the nature center (open only when the center is) and Bixby Art Park parking area; porta-potties are at the duck pond and sailing station. Several accessible picnic tables are by the duck pond; all are near the parking lot on firm grass or dirt, and two have shortened benches to provide integrated seating for at least two wheelchairs each. The Visitor Center is wheelchair-accessible."

Archaeological digs have uncovered remains from some of the city's earliest structures here. More than 5 million people visit the Presidio every year to hike or bike within the park's 1,491 acres. Two wheelchair-accessible trails run east-west through the northern section: the spectacular Golden Gate Promenade, a four-plus mile stretch of the Bay Trail that runs along the waterfront through Crissy Field's restored marshland to Civil War-era Fort Point; and the Presidio Promenade which travels through the heart of the historic Presidio, from the Lombard Street gate past the Main Post and San Francisco National Cemetery to the Golden Gate Bridge. West of the bridge, a short stretch of Coastal Trail brings you to an overlook atop the Presidio's rugged western bluffs; or you can visit Baker Beach and Battery Chamberlin. \n\nBefore setting off to explore the Presidio, you may want to stop at the visitor center at the Main Post (210 Lincoln Blvd.) to orient yourself. The staff here can answer your questions and provide maps and brochures. Interactive exhibits explain the park's fascinating history. Other visitor centers within the Presidio are at the Gulf of the Farallones Marine Sanctuary and Fort Point, along the Golden Gate Promenade; the pavilion at the Golden Gate Bridge Plaza provides visitor information and has a few exhibits, but is primarily a gift shop.\n\nACCESSIBILITY: An accessible free shuttle bus, PresidiGo, runs through the Presidio, making several stops (not all are accessible). The bus has space for two people in wheelchairs. There are designated accessible parking spaces at both ends. There are wheelchair-accessible restrooms at the Golden Gate Bridge Plaza (long lines here) or at the Visitors Center on the Main Post. The Visitors Center is wheelchair-accessible.\n\nThe Presidio Promenade's route follows both dedicated pathways and broad sidewalks and is not always clearly signed. The National Park web page for this trail says that the average grade is 2.9% and the maximum grade is 10.8%. To find your way, it's helpful to download the detailed Presidio map from the park's website or stop by the Visitor Center. Begin your trek along the Presidio Promenade just inside the Lombard Street Gate. The trail heads westward on the sidewalk along Lombard Street, then takes off on a broad asphalt path. On your right is the Letterman Digital Arts Center. Most of the buildings are off-limits to the public, but if you're a fan of the Star Wars films you may want to detour to Building B. Behind the complex, a mostly accessible landscaped park with a manmade lagoon and creek is also open.\n\nBack on the trail, follow the path to a broad sidewalk along Lincoln Boulevard. You soon come to Thompson's Reach, where a portion of a former creek has been restored. A short spur trail on your right leads down a moderate slope to an overlook with interpretive signs about the creek. Return to the main trail, following the sidewalk west a short distance to the Main Post, the heart of the Presidio since 1776. The Walt Disney Family Museum is near the visitor center.\n\nOn the Main Post, the Presidio Promenade follows the sidewalk past the transit center and post office, then, as you reach Montgomery Street, takes off on a broad multi-use path that winds behind the visitor center, following the route of the Presidio Parkway (formerly Doyle Drive). Here you have a panoramic view of the Golden Gate Strait through wire fencing. You soon pass the San Francisco National Cemetery, established in 1884. Just past the cemetery the promenade splits off from Lincoln Boulevard and descends a moderate slope to five brick cavalry stables. One still houses U.S. Park Police horses. Behind one of the stables you cross a 55-foot wooden bridge, then begin a gentle climb up to travel along Lincoln Boulevard again.\n\nPassing under Doyle Drive, with its massive stone supports and metalwork painted the same orange hue as the Golden Gate Bridge, you soon come to the Crissy Field Overlook. From here to the Golden Gate Bridge Plaza, where the promenade ends, is about half a mile. Be sure to look for a pullout with interpretive signs and interactive exhibits about the bridge.\n\nEl Polin Spring, at the end of MacArthur Avenue in a residential area southeast of the Main Post, has a short accessible loop trail (boardwalk and gravel) around a spring that was a source of freshwater for the native people and early settlers. A portion of the creek has been \"daylighted\" and native plants restored. This riparian habitat is an especially rewarding place for bird-watching, and picnic areas and parking are accessible."

Of the several entry points, the main one off Swan Way offers the easiest access to most of the park’s features. Visitors can enjoy miles of paved trails and picnic in a variety of settings, including on a large lawn with two fiberglass whale sculptures and Roger Berry’s “Duplex Cone” sculpture, which shows the sun’s high summer path and low winter path.\n\nA ramped observation deck looks out over Arrowhead Marsh, a 50-acre salt marsh that's a stopover for migratory birds on the Pacific Flyway and part of the Western Hemisphere Shorebird Reserve Network; birdwatching is a highlight here. You might see American avocets, black-necked stilts, pintail and cinnamon teal ducks, and perhaps even an endangered California clapper rail.\n\nAt the park's grassy southwestern end, off Doolittle Drive, is a fishing pier (with one step), group picnic areas, the accessible Shoreline Conference Center, and a boat launch. You will have to drive here from the main part of the park because Arrowhead Marsh Trail ends at Doolittle Drive and there is no sidewalk along Doolittle.\n\nThe Tidewater Boating Center at the park’s northern end has an ADA-accessible dock that is a popular launch area for kayakers; picnic grounds; and shoreline access for fishing.\n\nOne option is to start your trip from the observation deck, where there are good views of San Leandro Bay, and interpretive panels tell of the Bay’s shrinking wetlands and efforts to restore them. If you head south (left) on Arrowhead Marsh Trail, you will travel for about a mile along Airport Channel, an arm of the Bay, past grassy expanses that attract many geese. You will also pass the Martin Luther King Memorial Grove, a cluster of trees surrounding a grassy glade, and a brick wall inscribed with donors’ names. Along this stretch, traffic noise is loud and the airport dominates the view. The trail ends at Doolittle Dr.\n\nA more enjoyable option (roughly 4-miles roundtrip) is to head north on Arrowhead Marsh Trail from the observation deck. In this direction, you can cruise for miles along contiguous trails, including Garretson Point Trail and Damon Marsh Trail, and get close up-views of San Leandro Bay and Arrowhead Marsh. Immediately past a large deck with picnic tables, where people fish, the trail curves. If you continue straight you will be on San Leandro Creek Trail, a 1.75-mile paved loop along parallel paths on each side of the creek, crossing over the creek on Hegenberger Road. Picnic tables are scattered along the way. On a clear day, you can see San Francisco on the horizon.\n\nIn three-quarters of a mile, you reach Garretson Point, named for journalist Skip Garretson, whose articles helped gain protections for San Francisco Bay. Here you'll find a small native plant nursery where plants are grown to help restore the wetlands; beyond that, Damon Marsh is on your left and Edgewater Seasonal Wetlands are on the right. \n\nShortly after you cross Damon Slough, where the trail becomes the Damon Marsh Trail, which is a sculpture park with paths meandering around nature-inspired artwork. Traffic on nearby Zhone Way is noisy but fades into the background on the wooden deck at the marsh's edge, where there is abundant birdsong. For the next 1.5 miles the trail snakes along the bay, which is fringed with pickleweed and saltgrass. After you cross another bridge at East Creek Slough the trail curves behind an industrial area toward East Creek Point and the trail end at the Tidewater Boating Center.\n\nAccessibility: This trail is likely accessible for visitors using wheelchairs, mobility equipment, or strollers.\n\nAccessible Parking:\nNumber of designated accessible spaces: 4 at the trailhead;\nNumber of van-accessible spaces with access aisles: 4;\nParking lot surface: paved;\nAll of the park’s lots and staging areas have accessible spaces; Damon Slough, Garretson's Point, Tidewater, Doolittle, and the Swan Way entrance. \n\nTrail Details:\nTrail surface: paved asphalt, smooth;\nAverage trail width: 8 feet;\nEstimated average grade category: flat (1% or less);\nBenches: yes;\nPicnic Tables: yes – firm & stable path to tables, firm & stable surface, 27\" or greater knee clearance; The most accessible and scenic spots are the waterside tables at Garrettson Point and at the fishing dock. Some tables scattered along the trail can be reached in a wheelchair but may require travel on grass or firm dirt. Accessible group picnic areas are south of the viewing platform on expansive grassy areas. A few are at the Tidewater Boating Center.\nOther accessible features: wheelchair-accessible restrooms in the main section of the park, accessible restrooms are below the viewing deck."

For more information, please visit https://www.ebparks.org/parks/coyote-hills\n\nTrail Highlights: This route is fully exposed, but usually gets nice breezes from the bay. The hike has firm terrain with a combination of paved, packed dirt and gravel surfaces and an average trail width of 4 feet and above. For a gentler trail grade follow the lower Meadowlark trail in each direction. There is a $5 parking fee.\n\nPark Features: Located within Coyote Hills Regional Park next to the eastern shore of San Francisco Bay in Fremont, Dumbarton Quarry Campground on the Bay is the District’s first full-service campground, complete with 63 campsites, a camp store, an amphitheater, a playground, Wi-Fi, and picnic areas. Coyote Hills offers diverse lessons in history and many activities. At the Visitor Center, you can learn about Ohlone history, settlers and ranching, salt production, bio-sonar research, and more. Naturalist-led walks, tours of the Tuibun Ohlone Village, and visits to the Nectar Garden are also available. Other park features include picnic areas, Alameda Creek Trail, the marsh boardwalk, the nearby wildlife refuge, and salt evaporation ponds.\n\nTrail Directions: Start your route on the paved connector Serpentine Trail located in the campground behind the Patterson picnic area. Go right, past the picnic site, and turn left onto the paved Greenstone Trail which connects you to Coyote Hills. At the end of this trail go through the gate and make a left back onto the Serpentine Trail. In a little over a quarter-mile, there is an incline; proceed to the right towards the upper and lower Meadowlark trails. Take the lower or right-hand trail for the most accessible route. This trail is very bumpy and wheelchair riders can avoid some of the cross slope by straddling the raised middle sections. The Upper Meadowlark Trail is very steep but can be chosen as an alternate route since it goes to the same place. At the end of Meadowlark, continue on the packed gravel Apay Way Trail for a few yards and take a right onto the paved Bayview Trail. After about a mile on the Bayview trail, you will reach a bench on your right. Turn around here to complete the round trip or continue further to make your hike a little longer. Return to the campground by following the same route you just traveled."

    "description": "According to Access Northern California (http://accessnca.org/access-northern-california/explore/explore-detail-view/?site_id=215): Emeryville Peninsula, a curling finger jutting out into the bay, was one of the last major landfill projects on the bay. Its marinas and park are connected by two miles of paved Bay Trail. Powell Street leads to the peninsula’s tip, where the small lawns of Marina Park - screened by cypress and pine trees - face the bay.\n\nAs a designated site for the San Francisco Bay Water Trail, the marina has accessible launch facilities including an ADA gangway (with transition plates) that lead to a high-freeboard dock.\n\nACCESSIBILITY: All parking lots in the area reportedly have firm, accessible parking, although the northern lots have the easiest trail access for wheelchairs. The trail surface is paved with asphalt and cement and it is typically at least six feet wide. It is estimated to be mostly gentle in slope.\n\nOne can enter the paved Bay Trail at multiple locations but if you start at the pier and head south alongside the marina it ends at a construction site (as of August 2020) in less than 0.5 miles. For a longer hike, start from the pier and head north towards the bay. There are sweeping views of the Richmond–San Rafael Bridge, Mount Tamalpais, the Golden Gate Bridge, San Francisco, and the Bay Bridge. \n\nJust past China Village restaurant (there’s no easy wheelchair access from the trail to the restaurant) the trail curves inland and parallels Powell St. for one-mile to Frontage Rd. From here turn left to continue on the Bay Trail as it skirts McLaughlin State Park along the bay for another 2 miles to University Ave. in Berkeley by the Berkeley Marina. Please note the trail on this map continues past the Berkeley Marina so where the Access Northern California route ends has been marked on the map with a waypoint.\n\nThere are wheelchair accessible restrooms on the marina side of the park and accessible picnic tables with firm and stable paths and surfaces and at least 27 inches of knee clearance throughout the park. There is a sunken group picnic area near the marina members' restroom that is more sheltered from the wind."

The trail is a well-maintained gravel base until the last half mile. From this point, the trail is hard-packed dirt and rock. Difficulty can increase during the rainy season when the trail can be muddy and slippery.\n\nThe Stanford Avenue staging area is also the western access to the Ohlone Wilderness Trail, a 29-mile hiking and riding trail through some of southern Alameda County's most beautiful wilderness, and provides access to Mission Peak's 2,999 acres.\n\nEnsure that you have plenty of water before embarking on this hike, as there are very few spots to locate shade. The trail may be shared with equestrians, and dogs are allowed. There is very limited parking at Stanford Avenue Staging Area. It is best to park at Ohlone College to access Mission Peak: 43600 Mission Blvd to Anza Pine Road. Dogs are allowed on leash in developed areas/under voice command in undeveloped areas of the park."

    "description": "According to Access Northern California (http://accessnca.org/access-northern-california/explore/explore-detail-view/?site_id=130): Fort Mason, a former Army post dating from the Civil War era, is divided into Upper and Lower Fort Mason with the Great Meadow sandwiched between. The main draw to the 50-acre upper section is the expansive lawns of the Great Meadow where on most days you will see picnickers (no picnic tables), people throwing Frisbees, dog walkers, and even sunbathers on rare warm days. Its location on a bluff-top provides some nice views of the bay, including Golden Gate Bridge, but it also means that it can be windy here. There is level access onto the lawn throughout, however, less so at its eastern end. Wide, paved, gently sloping paths circumnavigate the meadow winding past a few statues. \n\nInside the fort complex, you can visit a community garden, stay at the accessible Fisherman's Wharf Hostel, and take a self-guided history tour. Lovely views of the Bay, Alcatraz Island, and the municipal pier are at the backside of the complex and from the Bay Trail (aka MacDowell Rd.).\n\nLower Fort Mason, on the waterfront, is home to the Fort Mason Center, a thriving cultural and educational complex with theaters, galleries, museums, a gourmet vegetarian restaurant, classrooms, exhibition spaces, and nonprofit organization offices including Environmental Traveling Companions that offers guided whitewater rafting, kayaking, and ski programs to people with disabilities and disadvantaged youth.  A farmers market takes place every Sunday, 9:30 am-1:30 pm.\n\nAfter exploring Fort Mason, you can extend your trip to the west by taking the Golden Gate Promenade along the Marina Green, through Crissy Field, and still further to Fort Point. Be sure to check out the Wave Organ, a wave-activated sound sculpture on a jetty jutting into the bay at the marina.\n\nThe Wave Organ is a stone \"sound sculpture\" built with chunks of old monuments and buildings from the 1915 Panama Pacific International Exposition, which was held in this area (the Marina Green was formerly a marsh, filled to accommodate the Exposition, in part using debris from the 1906 earthquake). \n\nACCESSIBILITY: Wheelchair-accessible entrances to Upper Fort Mason are on Bay Street at Franklin Street, MacArthur Avenue, and Van Ness Avenue. Accessible entrances to the Great Meadow are at the Bay Street parking lot, the west end of MacArthur Avenue, and at Laguna Street. Of the two Laguna Street entrances, the one closest to Bay Street has a gentle grade. The one closer to Marina Boulevard is steep. There is firm designated van-accessible parking with a slope no greater than 2% at the west end of MacArthur Avenue by the Great Meadow, in front of and behind the GGNRA offices, on Franklin Street across from the church, by General’s Residence, and within the quad. There is also a lot of parking spaces in the fee lot by the south end. The accessible parking at the trailhead is paved, has a striped access aisle, and is a paid spot.\n\nThe trail surface is paved. It is typically at least four feet wide. All of the sidewalks in the upper fort complex have curb ramps. Both manual and motorized wheelchair users will be able to easily explore accessible highlights of Upper Fort Mason. \n\nHowever, manual wheelchair users and others with reduced mobility may find the sloping topography around the meadow, and getting from lower Fort Mason to upper Fort Mason requires effort. The majority of the trail is estimated to be in the mostly gentle (5% or less) grade category but there are steeper sections at about 0.1 and 0.3-0.4 miles when going east. At the western side of the meadow, look for signage that indicates the accessible route to Lower Fort Mason. The steeper but more direct route may be manageable to some wheelchair users.\n\nA section of the Bay Trail runs along a cliff at the backside of Upper Fort Mason. It’s lined with eucalyptus and cypress trees but still affords views of lower Fort Mason, the Bay, and the Golden Gate Bridge. The trail’s entrance from the foot of Van Ness Avenue (near Aquatic Park Municipal Pier) is very steep. Alternatively, you can also reach the trail from the Great Meadow and then travel a few hundred feet further before it travels steeply downhill towards Van Ness Avenue. Adventurous and skilled wheelchair users may be able to travel this section––assistance may be required.\n\nIn Upper Fort Mason, to reach the vista point of the Bay and remnants of Black Point Battery and an authentic cannon, follow the sidewalk towards the water at Franklin Street to its end.\n\nThe visitor's center is wheelchair accessible. There are accessible bathrooms on the south side of the Great Meadow, in lower Fort Mason, and (while not considered public restrooms) within pier 2 (lower level of building C, and at the Conference Room at 308). Accessible picnic tables can be found by the hostel with nice views of the Great Meadow. The accessible chapel can be rented."

Among the many amenities you can find are multiple picnic areas, a grassy play area, fishing, an outdoor fitness zone with interactive exercise machines (one is designed for wheelchair access), and miles of lakefront trails. The Marina has a café, tackle and bait shop, rental boats, and seasonal lake tours aboard the tour boat \"Chabot Queen.\" The ramp to the boats is accessible but quite steep. To board the tour boat, a portable ramp is available.\n\nThe paved West Shore and East Shore trails around the lake offer some access, although their steep terrain may deter some with limited mobility. They are worth the effort if possible because it feels as though you’re far from the nearby bustling cities.\n\nAlthough paved, the West Shore Trail has numerous steep grades throughout as it travels high above the lake, passing in and out of shade provided by oaks, bay laurel, willow, and cottonwood trees. Poison oak is plentiful, as well as vetch, blackberries, and blue-eyed grass. A few interpretive panels about the dam’s history are towards the end of this 2-mile route. Benches are scattered throughout, although most have a steep grade to reach them."

The trail system goes through a variety of diverse environments including valleys, creeks, and ridges. The park is best suited for hiking and trail running. The PG&E Trail is a popular trail for runners. This trail stretches along rolling hills and electricity towers and provides a good cardio workout.

The park also provides opportunities for bikers and equestrians with cycling and equestrian trails and there is a large equestrian staging area. Bikes are only permitted on paved trails such as the Rancho San Antonio Trail. Horses are limited to the staging area the Coyote Trail, a;though horses are permitted on most trails within the Open Space Preserve.

While it's possible to hike more than 20 miles at a stretch in the interconnected preserves of the Mid-peninsula Open Space District, it's also nice to keep it simple with an easy stroll around a pond, and this not-too-difficult hike to the hillsides nearby. \n\nThis hike starts near Alpine Pond, moves on to the Ipewa Trail then loops back toward the pond via the Sunny Jim Trail. If you feel like exploring more, look for the Ohlone Indians' mortars behind a few rocks southwest of Alpine Pond. The Ohlones used these mortars to grind acorns into flour.\n\nThis full trail has too many steep sections over 8% and an unpaved surface to be marked as wheelchair/mobility equipment or stroller-friendly. The most accessible portion of the trail is the Alpine Pond Loop. This trail has its own trail page located here: https://www.alltrails.com/explore/trail/us/california/alpine-pond-loop"

The trails west of Skyline are exposed and consist of rolling hills and wild turkeys.  It was super foggy and cool. East of Skyline, enjoy the initial descent through chaparrals before hitting Table Mountain. The water level of the stream crossings were high, and required some creativity to cross. The last ascent on Grizzly Flat trail out of the canyon was dull, and on a steep, muddy fire road."

Sunol Regional Wilderness will make you forget you're just five miles from the nearest Interstate highway. The 6,858-acre park in the East Bay hills north of Silicon Valley has rolling hills, heart-healthy trails, remarkable rocks and abundant wildlife. To go there is to see what this part of California looked like hundreds of years ago.\n\nSunol is best suited for hikers, birders, and naturalists, though the large corral near the park HQ attracts a fair number of equestrians. There are no easy paths to the tall hills surrounding the HQ, but if you've got the legs and heart for a good workout, you'll find astounding vistas when the climbing is done.\n\nWinter and spring are the best times to go. It gets a bit too hot in July and August, but early autumn is a great time to see randy tarantulas on the hunt for mates (oddly enough, a spider the size of your fist in the wilderness is not nearly as frightful as the one the size of a dime in your bathroom)."

The area has an abundance of giant ferns, moss, and small streams as well as lots of local fauna. \n\nThe moderately hard hike travels through the lush groves of old-growth redwood trees and giant sequoias of the beautiful Santa Cruz mountains.

You can picnic and launch your small boat in this 20-acre park along Alviso Slough, at the southern end of San Francisco Bay, but the big draw is the many miles of levee trails that wrap around adjacent salt ponds. It’s an ideal place for spotting migratory birds and numerous resident birds, including northern harrier hawks, killdeer, song sparrows, and great egrets. You can easily spend all day here if you explore trails in the adjacent Don Edwards San Francisco Bay Wildlife Refuge.\n\nThe Environmental Education Center has displays on the South Bay’s ecology and history, a small bookstore, and replicas of the reed boats and shelters used by the native people. It is used for school programs and other events on weekdays and is open to the public on weekends. The entry door is rather heavy.\n\nThe town of Alviso was once envisioned as the bustling boating and shipping port of San Jose, but that prospect was diminished by a series of events, including the completion of the railroad, the relocation of the state capital from San Jose to Sacramento, and winter flooding and muddy conditions. Sparsely populated today, the town is listed in the Santa Clara County National Register of Historic Places.\n\nAccessibility: There is designated, van-accessible parking at the park entry, although the boat launch lot has no designated parking. The trail surface is partially boardwalk and partially dirt and it is typically at least four feet wide. It has an estimated gentle grade of 3% or less. There is a gentle slope by the trailheads. There is an accessible bathroom by the parking lot but not on the trail. There is an accessible picnic area near the parking lot with a firm and stable surface to the tables, firm and stable surfaces, and at least 27 inches of knee clearance."

These characteristics make the park a great place for outdoor recreation and nature appreciation on the urban/ wildland edge.\n\nTrails Highlights: Vargas Plateau is one of the more recent District parks to open to the public. The scenic trail slowly wraps up to the top of a lookout point, offering panoramic views of the surrounding cities (San Jose and Loma Prieta to the south, Mission Peak, Mt Hamilton and Rose Peak to the southeast, Sunol ridge to the north and San Bruno Mt, Twin Peaks and San Francisco to the west). You will notice from the trail posts that the trail you are following is part of the Bay Area Ridge Trail. Vargas Plateau is an open range park so be watchful for roaming cows. Parking and rest rooms available at the Vargas Plateau Staging Area.\n\nTrail Directions: Park at the Vargas Plateau Staging Area, and follow the trail past the restrooms, continuing through the gate. Keep going straight onto Golden Eagle Trail, past the next trail post. Golden Eagle Trail will contour around the hill and continue through another gate. At the second trail, pass through the gate to follow the Upper Ranch Trail. At the next trail post, stay to the left for the View Point Trail. The View Point Trail will ascend to the top of the hill.

    "description": "Shoreline Lake Park was originally a landfill, but the city of Mountain View turned it into a 750-acre recreation area with an 18-hole golf course and driving range, a 50-acre artificial lake filled with water pumped from the Bay, and nearly eight miles of trails, many of them along sloughs and marshes. You can hike, golf, boat on the saltwater lake, fly a kite, let your dog run free at the off-leash dog park, eat at the lakeside café, or loll around on lawns. Benches are plentiful throughout. At the restored, accessible Rengstorff House (ca. 1876) you can take a free docent-led tour of one of the finest examples of Victorian Italianate architecture remaining on the West Coast. \n\nA string of parks and preserves allows hikers to explore the Bay to the north and south. The undeveloped areas east and north of the lake are crossed by a couple of miles of pleasant, unnamed paved and hard gravel paths, including a more than 2-mile paved section of the SF Bay Trail. This trail connects to the Adobe Creek Loop Trail in the Palo Alto Baylands. Shoreline and Baylands parks harbor lots of wildlife, and you may see common birds.\n\nACCESSIBILITY: Three locations with wheelchair-accessible parking spaces offer good starting points for short strolls around the lake or longer outings along the salt ponds and marshes: Terminal Boulevard on the northern boundary, Shoreline Boathouse in the middle of the park, and the longer route from the kite-flying lot in the park’s southern section. Accessible restrooms are at the boathouse, near the Terminal Blvd. entrance, and at Michael’s café. Accessible portable toilets are in the kite-flying lot and at the dog park.\n\nThe trail surface is paved asphalt or dirt and it is typically at least five feet wide. It is mostly gentle with an estimated grade of 5% or less. Near the entrance to the lot, a paved trail connects to a service road that leads southeast for about 0.25 miles past a gravel-surfaced overflow lot for the amphitheater, passing a dog park on the right. At the first fork, stay right to wind around the Crittenden Pump Station, where the trail dips and then climbs to a fork. Turn left toward the Bay and follow along the western side of Stevens Creek Tidal Marsh. After a few hundred feet you come to a bridge to the paved Stevens Creek Trail. Here a right turn will take you south for more than three miles along the creek and through marshlands to Yuba Drive. If you turn left toward the Bay, you travel for 0.5 miles to the paved trail’s end at a fenced levee and a large salt pond. Where the pavement ends at the fenced levee, there is a hill with uneven surfaces and clumps of small rocks that might be challenging in a manual wheelchair, whether traveling uphill or down. From here, go left on the wide dirt trail (impassable in wet weather) that leads west along the shoreline to an intersection where you rejoin the paved trail. A salt pond is on your right.\n\nThe Shoreline Golf Links come into view as you near the restored Mountain View Tidal Marsh. Veer left at the marsh to a viewing platform (steep approach). You can then continue around the marsh, traveling north toward the lake, or return to the kite-flying lot via a trail alongside the park’s main entrance road. If you continue, you will cross Permanente Creek near its inlet into the marsh, and soon arrive in the parking lot that serves the boathouse and lakeside café. Both the dock and the beach launching area are accessible.\n\nA paved trail leads north from the boathouse. Where it splits, stay left to travel along the lakeshore. Past the sailing scow play structure, the trail surface changes to decomposed granite. The trail ends on the lake’s northeastern side. If you go right instead of left at the split, you travel toward the Bay alongside Mountain View Tidal Marsh. This trail veers left at the Bay, leading more than 0.5 miles along the shore of another large salt pond to the Coast Casey Forebay, a flood control basin, and Charleston Slough. The accessible viewing platform extending over the slough provides excellent birding opportunities. From the platform, you can extend your trip several miles on the hard-packed dirt-and-gravel Adobe Creek Trail winding through Palo Alto Baylands.\n\nContinuing past the viewing platform, you arrive at the Terminal Boulevard entrance to the park. You can return to the boathouse lot via the paved service road that leads to the right. It cuts through the middle of the golf course and crosses Permanente Creek after 0.8 miles. On the other side of the bridge you can turn left onto the Permanente Creek Trail, which winds for 0.25 miles back to"

    "description": "According to Access Northern California (http://accessnca.org/access-northern-california/explore/explore-detail-view/?site_id=178): The Baylands Nature Preserve, said to be the largest salt marsh preserve on the Bay, encompasses nearly 2,000 acres protected for wildlife, including the endangered clapper rail and salt marsh harvest mouse. The preserve contains a duck pond (formerly a saltwater swimming pool); tidal and freshwater marshes; a sailing station for windsurfers and hand-carried, non-motorized boats; and almost 15 miles of trails, all of which have some wheelchair access. Although quite a few of the trails are along roads or in built-up areas, many are close to attractive sloughs where a wide variety of birds can be seen even without binoculars, and some are out in the marshlands, where a flock of sandpipers or a lonely blue heron may be your only company.\n\nJackrabbits are frequently seen in the restored wildlands above the high-water line, where gray foxes and burrowing owls are said to breed. But within the preserve you'll also find a sewage treatment plant, an airport, and a former landfill for the city of San Francisco, which is now a grassy garbage mountain named the Bixby Art Hill, home to several very understated pieces of public art. Highway 101 is nearby, as is Palo Alto's golf course.\n\nThe difficulty rating for this trail is based on the experience that a wheelchair or stroller user may have due to the gravel surface.\n\nVisitor center: A quarter-mile down the road from the duck pond is the Lucy Evans Baylands Nature Interpretive Center. Inside are displays about the wildlife you might see at the preserve and an ecology laboratory where visitors can prepare their own slides and examine them under microscopes. The microscopes are on a 25-inch-high shelf, but a video microscope that projects slides onto a monitor permits easier viewing. The center also offers videos, nature walks, and a variety of natural history programs for children and adults. On the wooden deck surrounding the nature center, use the low-mounted telescope to zoom in on shorebirds and waterfowl. A long boardwalk extending from the center across Harriet Mundy Marsh may be closed for major renovations. Located at 2775 Embarcadero Road, 650-329-2506.\n\nACCESSIBILITY: The trail parallels the north side of Embarcadero Road between Bixby Art Hill and the sailing station for about half a mile, with views across the slough and a pickleweed marsh. It is not paved, and the estimated slope is gentle, all 3% or less. Interpretive panels provide information along the way. Traffic on the road is light and slow-moving, and you will never be far from a restroom. The trail has some access problems, including a soft surface in places and some small hills, but a bike lane next to the level road can serve as an alternate route if the trail poses a problem. Opposite the duck pond, this trail has a very rough section with a couple of small rises and some soft surfaces. In some places the surface is dirt and likely to be muddy in wet weather.\n\nThere is designated accessible parking (van accessible), firm, and level or slope no greater than 2% at the Adobe Creek trailhead, where the one designated space is very likely to be occupied. Each of the several small lots along Embarcadero Rd. also has a van-accessible space, and at the sailing station, a gravel lot has several van-accessible spaces. Wheelchair-accessible restrooms with running water are at the nature center (open only when the center is) and Bixby Art Park parking area; porta-potties are at the duck pond and sailing station. Several accessible picnic tables are by the duck pond; all are near the parking lot on firm grass or dirt, and two have shortened benches to provide integrated seating for at least two wheelchairs each. The Visitor Center is wheelchair-accessible."

For more information, please visit https://www.ebparks.org/parks/coyote-hills\n\nAccording to Access Northern California (http://accessnca.org/access-northern-california/explore/explore-detail-view/?site_id=19): This 1.3-mile trail offers Bay views similar to those along the Bay View Trail but is a bumpier and much more challenging ride. This trail is great if you want to connect to Don Edwards San Francisco Bay National Wildlife Refuge (Fremont) or see the working quarry at the end of the trail.\n\nThis trail takes you about 30 feet above the water, with great views of the abundant waterfowl, until you make a steep ascent to a small eucalyptus grove, where tree roots have made the asphalt uneven. The trail levels out for a good distance but is rockier as you get closer to the quarry. It travels steeply downhill to a bridge that crosses Hwy. 84, then ends at the entrance road to Don Edwards San Francisco Bay National Wildlife Refuge.\n\nAccessibility: This trail is likely accessible with assistance for visitors using wheelchairs, mobility equipment, or strollers or visitors may need to avoid the steeper and unpaved/stair sections for safety. \n\nThe trail begins with a gentle uphill climb along a hillside, and although the path is greater than 5 feet wide, there’s a ridge down the center––likely from erosion––that makes the trail uneven. The trail is widest closest to the hillside. Assistance may also be needed in the last third of the trail where the surface is rougher. From the Quarry Staging Area, follow the asphalt trail near the porta-potty. It gently climbs 0.14 miles, then crosses Meadowlark Trail and continues another 0.07 miles to the Apay Way trailhead. There's a slight drop-off onto the trail. Use caution, as you get closer to the quarry and bridge the surface becomes rockier and steeper.\n\nAccessible Parking:\nNumber of designated accessible spaces: 2 at the trailhead;\nNumber of van-accessible spaces with access aisles: 2;\nParking lot surface: paved.\n\nTrail Details:\nTrail surface: paved asphalt, gravel, a natural surface (dirt), firm;\nAverage trail width: 4 feet;\nEstimated average grade category: mostly gentle (5% or less) with steeper sections at about 1.1, 1.6, 2.1, and 2.9 miles when going south;\nOther accessible features: wheelchair-accessible visitor center, accessible restrooms in the visitor center, an accessible vault toilet at Dairy Glen campground, and accessible portable toilets in the visitor center and Quarry Staging area parking lots."

    "description": "According to Access Northern California (http://accessnca.org/access-northern-california/explore/explore-detail-view/?site_id=178): The Baylands Nature Preserve, said to be the largest salt marsh preserve on the Bay, encompasses nearly 2,000 acres protected for wildlife, including the endangered clapper rail and salt marsh harvest mouse. The preserve contains a duck pond (formerly a saltwater swimming pool); tidal and freshwater marshes; a sailing station for windsurfers and hand-carried, non-motorized boats; and almost 15 miles of trails, all of which have some wheelchair access. Although quite a few of the trails are along roads or in built-up areas, many are close to attractive sloughs where a wide variety of birds can be seen even without binoculars, and some are out in the marshlands, where a flock of sandpipers or a lonely blue heron may be your only company.\n\nJackrabbits are frequently seen in the restored wildlands above the high-water line, where gray foxes and burrowing owls are said to breed. But within the preserve, you'll also find a sewage treatment plant, an airport, and a former landfill for the city of San Francisco, which is now a grassy garbage mountain named the Bixby Art Hill, home to several very understated pieces of public art. Highway 101 is nearby, as is Palo Alto's golf course.\n\nVisitor center: A quarter-mile down the road from the duck pond is the Lucy Evans Baylands Nature Interpretive Center. Inside are displays about the wildlife you might see at the preserve and an ecology laboratory where visitors can prepare their own slides and examine them under microscopes. The microscopes are on a 25-inch-high shelf, but a video microscope that projects slides onto a monitor permits easier viewing. The center also offers videos, nature walks, and a variety of natural history programs for children and adults. On the wooden deck surrounding the nature center, use the low-mounted telescope to zoom in on shorebirds and waterfowl. A long boardwalk extending from the center across Harriet Mundy Marsh may be closed for major renovations. Located at 2775 Embarcadero Road, 650-329-2506.\n\nACCESSIBILITY: This short unpaved gravel loop trail around a small pond busy with ducks and geese might be pleasant after a picnic, but for about half the distance it wanders away to overlook a nameless slough with little bird activity. The whole trail is estimated to be in the flat (1% or less) grade category. This trail will likely be navigable for most wheelchairs/mobility equipment or stroller users.\n\nThere is 2 designated accessible parking (van accessible), firm, and level or slope no greater than 2% at the Adobe Creek trailhead. Each of the several small lots along Embarcadero Road also has a van-accessible space, and at the sailing station, a gravel lot has several van-accessible spaces. Wheelchair-accessible restrooms with running water are at the nature center (open only when the center is) and Bixby Art Park parking area; porta-potties are at the duck pond and sailing station. Several accessible picnic tables are by the duck pond; all are near the parking lot on firm grass or dirt, and two have shortened benches to provide integrated seating for at least two wheelchairs each. The Visitor Center is wheelchair-accessible."

This makes for a great escape to nature.\n\nThe beginning of this route is located at the top of Skyline Blvd. and starts off relatively flat with great views of the Bay Area. Eventually, it descends down towards the creek and through groves of redwood trees. These coast redwoods provide lots of shade year-round making this a nice hike in both the rainy months and the warmer summer months. Once you reach the Bridle and Stream Trails, the path flattens out again and is even paved in a few areas. There are several picnic tables to stop at and rest before you continue the trek back up to the parking lot.\n\nThis is a great place for a long dog walk or a challenging trail run. While the trails in this area can get a bit busy on the weekends, there are enough trails and combinations to feel like you get your own piece of the redwood forest. There are many staging areas in the area so please be aware of equestrians and their horses."

This loop to the peak is a good way to get there: steep enough to provide a good workout and scenic enough to reward your efforts. \n\nCoyote Peak looks out over the southern expanse of Silicon Valley, with great views of both the Diablo Range to the east and the Santa Cruz Mountains to the west. Admittedly, this park is not the sexiest hiking locale in the South Bay, but it's extremely accessible if you're in the neighborhood. And let's face it: few city parks have hills with this much elevation gain.  \n\nBear in mind that the park is very popular with mountain bikers, so come prepared to share the trails. \n\nThis hike starts out at the Pueblo Day Use Area; you have to pay to park here, but the amenities (bathrooms, water, picnic tables, lots of parking spaces) are usually unavailable at the free trailheads around the park.  \n\nBest time to come: If you come early in the morning before it gets too hot, you can hike here all year. Springtime wildflower season is very scenic, and winter offers the best views from Coyote Peak after a strong rain cleans up the smog. Summer and fall will be hot and dry with significant wildfire risk."

Walk along the paved path past the pollinator garden and continue onto Water Slide Trail. Continue around to the right side of the marsh. The path runs parallel to Stanley Boulevard, looping around the marsh. At an intersection before the BMX park, take the Levee Trail to the left. When you reach the junction, cross over the water on the cement bridge to the right. After the bridge, head uphill on the middle path, then turn to the left. Take the South Arroyo Trail for 0.15 miles, then cross back over the bridge and turn right onto the North Arroyo Trail. Head east on the trail as it takes you back along the waterline to a shaded, tree-­‐lined area.\nThe North Arroyo Trail will come out of the woodland and loop back around to the Levee Trail. Once you reach the Levee Trail, turn left and head back to the intersection towards Water Slide Trail and follow it to the right back towards the entry kiosk.\n\nPark/Gate Hours: Varies monthly (check website for times)\nFees: $6 per vehicle, $5 per trailered vehicle\n$2 per dog.

Find the list of dog-friendly segments here: http://www.walking-the-bay.com/p/dog-friendly-bay-trail-segments.html\n\nAccording to Access Northern California (http://accessnca.org/access-northern-california/explore/explore-detail-view/?site_id=189): The 1,700-acre Hayward Regional Shoreline provides habitat to hundreds of species of birds and other wildlife. Along the regional shoreline the Bay Trail extends for 8 miles, past marshes and creeks to the San Leandro Marina, with its popular park and jogging course. The shoreline trail is almost level and mostly firm with a gravel or pavement surface. There are four entry points to the trail, so you can take a long ride, watching the light change the look of the Oakland and San Francisco skylines, or make it a short trip. There is no shade along the way, so bring a hat.\n\nChanges in weather can alter this shoreline dramatically. Sometimes cold, fierce winds blow and the water is gray; at other times it ripples and glints in the sun. At low tide, mudflats stretch for yards, while high tides bring acres of open water. Time your visit for a receding tide to see crowds of wading birds foraging at the water’s edge. With marsh views to the east and the Bay to the west, there is always plenty to marvel at.\n\nPark Hours: Between 5 AM and 10 PM unless otherwise posted\n\nAccessibility: The southernmost entrance at Breakwater Ave. has no off-street parking, but several wheelchair-accessible spaces are in front of the interpretive center. West Winton Ave. has no designated disabled parking spaces in the two large lots with gravel surfacing. The Grant Ave. lot has designated accessible spaces on level asphalt. An accessible portable toilet is at the trail’s start on Breakwater Ave. The next accessible public restroom on the shoreline is 7 miles away at the San Leandro Marina - there are no other wheelchair-accessible restrooms along the entire route. The slope of this route is mostly gentle (all 5% grade or less).\n\nThe interpretive center is a great starting point for exploring 5 miles of gravel trail, either on your own or with one of the many ranger-led programs. At a little over a mile out you can add to your excursion and take the 1.2-mile loop around Cogswell Marsh, a salt marsh restoration project that was completed in 1980. After another half-mile, you reach a landfill loop. The paths that climb this low, flat hill are steep enough to deter most wheelchair riders, but the adventurous may enjoy the view from the top, where a nearly level trail travels out to overlook the Bay and other hikers passing along the trail. Back on the shoreline trail, you reach Hayward’s Landing in half a mile. The landfill loop paths are 30 inches to 4 feet wide. The main trail is a gravel levee service road closed to cars. The landfill loop is likely to be muddy in wet weather."

Next-best time is spring, when the hills are green and the wildflowers are out. It's too hot in summer, and probably not worth risking in fall if you can't carry enough water for the entire day.\n\nThis route goes to Antler Point, highest in the park; climbs Washburn trail, steepest in the park; and follows a long stretch of the Bay Area Ridge Trail, which has some of the best views."

Zielle Creek Trail is shaded by lush oaks and bays, and the creek usually runs well after the rainy season.

Cross through the cattle gate and take the right-hand path for .48 mile. At the next signpost, make a left and continue for about 100 feet until you come to a sign for Newt Pond Trail. The trail is immediately to your right, and is small enough to look like a cattle trail. Take Newt Pond Trail for .38 mile, then cross the stream and turn right at the fork to head up to Vista Peak Loop.

    "description": "According to Access Northern California (http://accessnca.org/access-northern-california/explore/explore-detail-view/?site_id=178): The Baylands Nature Preserve, said to be the largest salt marsh preserve on the Bay, encompasses nearly 2,000 acres protected for wildlife, including the endangered clapper rail and salt marsh harvest mouse. The preserve contains a duck pond (formerly a saltwater swimming pool); tidal and freshwater marshes; a sailing station for windsurfers and hand-carried, non-motorized boats; and almost 15 miles of trails, all of which have some wheelchair access. Although quite a few of the trails are along roads or in built-up areas, many are close to attractive sloughs where a wide variety of birds can be seen even without binoculars, and some are out in the marshlands, where a flock of sandpipers or a lonely blue heron may be your only company.\n\nJackrabbits are frequently seen in the restored wildlands above the high-water line, where gray foxes and burrowing owls are said to breed. But within the preserve you'll also find a sewage treatment plant, an airport, and a former landfill for the city of San Francisco, which is now a grassy garbage mountain named the Bixby Art Hill, home to several very understated pieces of public art. Highway 101 is nearby, as is Palo Alto's golf course.\n\nVisitor center: A quarter-mile down the road from the duck pond is the Lucy Evans Baylands Nature Interpretive Center. Inside are displays about the wildlife you might see at the preserve and an ecology laboratory where visitors can prepare their own slides and examine them under microscopes. The microscopes are on a 25-inch-high shelf, but a video microscope that projects slides onto a monitor permits easier viewing. The center also offers videos, nature walks, and a variety of natural history programs for children and adults. On the wooden deck surrounding the nature center, use the low-mounted telescope to zoom in on shorebirds and waterfowl. A long boardwalk extending from the center across Harriet Mundy Marsh may be closed for major renovations. Located at 2775 Embarcadero Road, 650-329-2506.\n\nACCESSIBILITY: For some reason, Adobe Creek Trail has two branches; this one runs south along Mayfield Slough and Matadero Creek all the way to Highway 101, skirting the garbage mountain and providing a view of more Bixby art. It is fairly wheelchair-accessible, but it's not a very interesting walk unless you want to see the hillside art. The hard, fine gravel is not well spread over the entire distance, although the slope is estimated to be gentle (all 3% or less). Benches are provided frequently along the first half-mile, but they are placed down from the trail by the water and so are difficult for people with mobility disabilities to use.\n\nThere is designated accessible parking (van accessible), firm, and level or slope no greater than 2% at the Adobe Creek trailhead, where the one designated space is very likely to be occupied. Each of the several small lots along Embarcadero Rd. also has a van-accessible space, and at the sailing station, a gravel lot has several van-accessible spaces. Wheelchair-accessible restrooms with running water are at the nature center (open only when the center is) and Bixby Art Park parking area; porta-potties are at the duck pond and sailing station. Several accessible picnic tables are by the duck pond; all are near the parking lot on firm grass or dirt, and two have shortened benches to provide integrated seating for at least two wheelchairs each. The Visitor Center is wheelchair-accessible."

    "description": "According to Access Northern California (http://accessnca.org/access-northern-california/explore/explore-detail-view/?site_id=134): A wide, level asphalt section of the Bay Trail known as the Mill Valley-Sausalito Path, popular with cyclists, runners, and rollerbladers, follows the old Northwestern Pacific Railroad route from Sausalito to Mill Valley. Along the way it crosses Bothin Marsh Open Space Preserve, 112 acres of open space and restored salt marsh with dirt trails that may be accessible during the dry season. The marsh attracts more than 400 species of migratory birds in winter, as well as providing habitat for native birds and other wildlife. By continuing north on the trail, you will reach Bayfront Park in Mill Valley.\n\nIf starting from the Pohono Street trailhead by the Shoreline Office Center (wheelchair accessible access point), the trail travels under the Richardson Bay Bridge, then follows the edge of the marsh, crossing four small wooden bridges that rise over creeks and channels. When bicycle traffic is light, these are great places to watch for marine life as the tide surges in or out, but they may be flooded during very high tides, especially after heavy rains. Shorebirds abound and interpretive panels give historical and ecological information about Richardson Bay. On a clear day, Mount Tamalpais looms to the north as you travel this stretch of trail.\n\nAbout 1.5 miles out, you come to 14-acre Bayfront Park, which surrounds a quiet inlet at the northernmost tip of Richardson Bay. The western side of the park contains an off-leash dog run, sports fields, a skateboard park, and picnic tables. A bridge with a two-inch ledge at both ends leads to the park's eastern side, with a playground, softball field, and more sports fields. From the east-side parking lot, a paved trail leads south a few hundred yards. At the \"Public Shoreline\" sign, follow the decomposed-granite trail uphill to an overlook with a view of the lagoon below. Steps lead down from the crest of the hill to a 0.25-mile trail that hugs the shoreline, traveling behind a landscaped condominium complex.\n\nACCESSIBILITY: A portion of this trail is considered wheelchair and stroller friendly - the suggested parking area (Shoreline Office Center) and suggested area to turn around (Bayfront Park) have been marked on the map with waypoints. There is firm, designated, van-accessible parking with a slope of less than 2% at the Shoreline Office Center at the south end of the trail and by Bayfront Park at the north end in the Mill Valley Middle School parking lot or parking lots off of Hamilton Dr.\n\nThe trail has a smooth, paved surface and is typically at least six feet wide. It is estimated to be flat, with a grade all 1% or less. The decomposed-granite path on the hill at Bayfront Park may be too steep for manual wheelchairs without assistance. To reach the shoreline trail at the bottom of the hill and avoid the stairs with a wheelchair, you need to backtrack to the shoreline sign and continue on the sidewalk, turning onto Shelter Bay Avenue where it dead-ends at the trail.\n\nThere are accessible restrooms at Bayfront Park on the eastern side in the northernmost parking lot off Hamilton Dr. The picnic tables on the western side of Bayfront Park near the dog park are on a firm, level surface but do not have knee clearance, unfortunately."

This 2.5-mile stretch of shoreline (once known as the “Coney Island of the West”) is commemoratively named for the late Assemblyman Robert W. Crown. Today the shoreline lacks the roller coasters and thrill rides it once had, but the beaches are popular for swimming, board sports, kayaking and more. Private equipment rentals and lessons are available during the summer season. The shoreline is an important habitat for native birds and sea creatures. At low\ntide, visitors explore the abundant wildlife that exists below the water’s surface. The Crab Cove Visitor Center offers extensive knowledge about the shoreline to the public and charter groups. Interpretive programs are offered on the weekends, and on weekdays by reservation.\n\nTrail Highlights: This featured route follows the SF Bay Trail to Encinal Beach. From Encinal Beach continue for about a half mile to the USS Hornet Museum, which is open daily for tickets, tours, and a comprehensive history exhibit. The trail is mostly paved (gravel just before Encinal Beach). Parts of this route utilize city streets, so double check your understanding of the route before taking off.\n\nTrail Directions: Portions of this route are on city streets. Turn right on the paved trail at the end of McKay Ave. (in front of large park office building). Follow through a small gate (this gate and the one at Central Avenue remain open from dawn to dusk). Continue for .4 miles, passing by the private residences of Crown Harbor toward Central Avenue. Upon meeting Central Avenue turn left. Follow the sidewalk for .6 miles. After passing in front of Encinal High School, turn left down the road marked SF Bay Trail and Encinal Boat Ramp to Encinal Beach; this is a long, straight stretch to the parking lot – be aware of cars as you head to the shore. After passing though the parking lot, turn right on the SF Bay Trail and continue for about a half mile to the USS Hornet Museum. Explore the exhibit or retrace your steps back to the Crown Cove Visitor Center.\n\nPark Curfew/Hours: 5 a.m. to 10 p.m.\nFees: $5 parking fee (when attended)"

You'll pass the remains of a settler's cabin and see expansive vistas looking out over the Diablo Range. Sightings of deer, coyotes, vultures, and raptors are common.\n\nHiking the Ohlone Trail requires a permit/map ($2, available from the Sunol headquarters). Start at Mile 12, and sign the trail register at the trail board near the corral across the road from the park HQ. \n\nThe trail climbs steeply out of Sunol Wilderness, crosses Calaveras Road and continues toward the peak; at the last approach to the summit, the trail takes a Y, where you can go left or right; left is a bit shorter, and offers a chance to rest at the Eagle Spring campsite. \n\nThe best time to go is springtime when the hills are green and the wildflowers are blooming.

At one point this whole hillside was logged, but now a new redwood forest is reclaiming the land. It's a great place to experience nature's regenerative powers first-hand. Trails on this track: Bear Gulch Trail, Skyline Trail, and Alambique Trail.\n\nWunderlich is on a hillside at the foot of the Santa Cruz Mountains; you start at the bottom so it's pretty much uphill for most of the first half, but it's downhill for the rest.\n\nAlso, the Redwood Trail is a pretty side trip, and The Meadows is an excellent open area for taking a snack break.\n\nThe best time to come is springtime because it will be a bit more scenic as the wildflowers bloom. The deepest redwood section offers a cool break from the summer heat. The redwood canopy even offers some protection on a rainy hike."

Since the length and elevation gain are moderately easy, this is a great option for building endurance on the journey to completing more challenging hikes. This trail is flat pretty much the whole time except at Slippery Rock which offers a short but steep incline, which is also a culturally significant location with very flat rock that indigenous people used as a mortar and pestle!\n\nClose to the waterfall, you can use stairs to get to a nice viewpoint and get closer vantages for great photos and a mist experience. From here, you can also view the Opal Mineral Pool below, which is iconic and a sight to behold. From this location, the trail can be treated as either an out-and-back by simply returning, or continuing along the AllTrails verified route loop. As the trail continued higher, the gorgeous Sequoia trees provided shade for most of the way, and the trail can at times be slippery in spring and fall when intense rain can occur. While there may not be panoramic views like more challenging hikes would offer, this trail is unique in the access to natural landscapes. \n\nParking can be difficult to find during the summer or nicer spring and fall weekends, and you should be prepared to wait in line when paying if busy. If additional parking is required, there is more available further down the road at other parking lots. It is also recommended to bring bug spray in the spring and early summer, since the further into this hike, the more bug bites that will happen."

(Note that the bike trails are a bit different from the hiking trail.)\n\nThe trail begins at Candlestick Point and ends at Lands End. As you follow the trek across San Francisco, check out the different sights this trail has to offer (such as the beautiful Moraga Steps, which is also listed in AllTrails). Hikers will be able to walk past different gardens, coffee shops, bookstores and more! Thirsty? Stop by one of San Francisco's local coffee shops for some good old joe (and maybe a pastry or two)!\n\nAt the end of the trail, hikers can grab dinner at Lands End. Users have reported that this trail takes most of the day if starting early. That being said you may be able to catch the sunset at Lands End! Looking to hike some more? Check out the Lands End Trail, another fun San Francisco hike!\n\nHikers can also opt out of hiking the whole trail as this trail is also connected by public transportation systems."

Just a few short miles from the bustle of San Francisco lies the relative peace and quiet of the Marin Headlands where you can enjoy Golden Gate views among rolling hills and soaring raptors.\n\nThis route guides you along the San Francisco bay from Chrissy Field and on to the Golden Gate Bridge. From there you hang a left and head for the hills. The first part of the journey into the hills consists of a constant uphill climb for around 500ft (150m) until reaching the summit of Hawk Hill. Zipping downhill on the curvy coastal road will lead you quickly past even more scenery, a multitude of old military concrete defense structures and towards Point Bonita."

The Oakland’s mast heralds the park’s many historical maritime features, including bollards for tying up ships, pier remnants, and the outlined footprint of the Navy’s four-acre warehouse. Other features include a sandy beach, an amphitheater, a large restored salt marsh, and nearly three miles of wide, level trails that weave through the park.\n\nAt the park’s center is Point Arnold, a 16-acre grassy peninsula with a wharf (44-inch railings), an accessible viewing telescope, and picnic sites.\n\nNearby Port View Park juts into San Francisco Bay on a man-made peninsula. This little park, once a railway terminus, provides great views of operations at the nearby Port of Oakland Seventh Street Terminal, and you can fish here without a license. Just west of the parking lot is the “Room With a View” exhibit in the train tower, where railway personnel once directed traffic. A wheelchair lift takes you up to the second story, affording fantastic views of the port, the Bay Bridge, and both downtown Oakland and San Francisco, which are about equidistant from the pier. Take a look at the exhibit, too, where you will learn about Oakland’s role in the Bay Area's development.\n\nACCESSIBILITY: Several lots, all reachable from either Middle Harbor Rd. or Seventh St., have designated accessible spaces that are firm and with a slope of 2% or less, including the one at the southernmost end of the park road. Wheelchair-accessible restrooms (open during staff hours) are west of the Oakland’s mast near the east parking lot, and on the ground floor of the Mole’s observation tower. Several accessible picnic tables (firm and stable paths and surfaces and at least 27 inches of knee clearance) are at the park's center; one is on the pier.\n\nFor great views as well as an overview of the park, begin your exploration at the observation tower at the park’s southern end. The grade is mostly gentle (5% or less) for the whole route. Trails throughout the park have eroded and are rough in places. Don't expect a smooth ride. The width is typically at least four feet. It's best to follow the upper path from the parking lot to the tower because from the lower path you have to take an elevator to the tower, and it is out of service frequently.\n\nNext, backtrack to the lower trails that traverse the 10-acre peninsula, which was the site of the Western Pacific Mole, an early 20th-century railroad terminal that provided both a shipping connection for local and international freight and a ferry station to take railroad passengers to and from San Francisco.\n\nWork your way back to the parking lot, where you can pick up the .75-mile shoreline promenade that links to the park’s center and Point Arnold at the northern end.\n\nPast the picnic area is Point Arnold and the wharf where people fish; a California fishing license is required here. You can extend your trip another half-mile to Port View Park on a section of Bay Trail that parallels Seventh Street and the railroad tracks."

On one side, the shimmering waters of San Francisco Bay offer stunning views, while on the other, native plants like coastal sagebrush and coyote bush provide habitats for local wildlife. Watch for shorebirds—sandpipers, willets, and herons are frequent visitors, often seen wading in the shallows or darting along the tide line. Interpretive panels along the way provide fascinating insights into the estuary's delicate ecosystem, from its tidal flows to the role it plays as a nursery for marine life. There are also picnic tables strategically placed for trailgoers to pause and enjoy a meal, perhaps while watching windsurfers dance across the waves.\n\nTrail Directions:\nFrom the McKay Avenue entrance, head straight to the shoreline. Turn left onto the Bay Trail following the shoreline at Freshwater Lagoon. Turn left, walk to the end of Freshwater Lagoon, then retrace steps back to Bay Trail. Turn left, walk toward the bathhouse. At the bathhouse retrace the path and return to the Visitor Center to learn about the park’s history and marine life.\n\nAccessibility:\nRobert W. Crown Memorial State Beach offers several ADA-accessible features. The paved Bay Trail runs along the shoreline, providing a smooth, level surface for wheelchair users and those with mobility devices. Accessible parking is available near major trailheads, with designated spaces close to restrooms equipped with grab bars and sufficient maneuvering space. The park also offers a beach wheelchair, which can be reserved in advance. Picnic areas have accessible tables with firm, stable surfaces, and the Visitor Center is fully accessible, offering exhibits and programs for all."

There are several logs at the entrance to the path at about 0.7 miles that create an obstacle of about six inches every three feet.\n\nThe most accessible portion of the trail is the paved portion in the first about 0.7 miles when going east. The majority of the trail is estimated to be in the mostly gentle (5% or less) grade category but there are steeper sections at about 1.9-4.0, 4.8, and 5.1 miles when going clockwise. Trail goers using wheelchairs/mobility equipment or strollers may need assistance in the steeper sections or to avoid them for safety. All-terrain tires or motorized equipment may be needed for the surface type and grade after about 0.7 miles. The most accessible portion of the trail is the Los Alamitos Creek Trail and Calero Creek Trail: https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/california/los-alamitos-creek-trail-and-calero-creek-trail"

Of the several entry points, the main one off Swan Way offers the easiest access to most of the features. Visitors can enjoy miles of paved trails and picnic in a variety of settings, including on a large lawn with two fiberglass whale sculptures and Roger Berry’s “Duplex Cone” sculpture.\n\nA ramped observation deck looks out over Arrowhead Marsh, a 50-acre salt marsh that's a stopover for migratory birds on the Pacific Flyway and part of the Western Hemisphere Shorebird Reserve Network; birdwatching is a highlight here. You might see American avocets, black-necked stilts, pintail and cinnamon teal ducks, and perhaps even an endangered California clapper rail.\n\nAt the park's grassy southwestern end, off Doolittle Drive, is a fishing pier (with one step), group picnic areas, the accessible Shoreline Conference Center, and a boat launch. You will have to drive here from the main part of the park because Arrowhead Marsh Trail ends at Doolittle Drive and there is no sidewalk along Doolittle.\n\nThe Tidewater Boating Center at the park’s northern end has an ADA-accessible dock that is a popular launch area for kayakers; picnic grounds; and shoreline access for fishing.\n\nThis portion of the Arrowhead Marsh Trail travels south along the Arrowhead Marsh.

Some tables along the trail can be reached in a wheelchair, but may require travel on grass or firm dirt. Accessible group picnic areas are south of the viewing platform on grassy areas. A few are at the Tidewater Boating Center.\nOther accessible features: wheelchair-accessible restrooms are below the viewing deck (no stall door) and off the entrance road between King Fisher and Plover picnic areas. The restrooms at Garretson Point have grab bars only on the sides, the toilet height is 15 inches, and the women’s stall allows only a frontal transfer. The men’s has a lowered urinal and no stall door. A good accessible restroom is at Doolittle Drive between the Blue Heron and Rail picnic areas. The Tidewater staging area has accessible restrooms."

It then takes you to Santa Teresa County Park with a short detour to Coyote Peak. The parking area at the trailhead is limited, so it's recommended that you arrive early. Coyote Peak offers stunning views of Silicon Valley, with the Diablo Range to the east and the Santa Cruz Mountains to the west. During the spring, you'll find beautiful wildflowers and butterflies. Be prepared for rocky sections and very little shade."

This is the 12th section of the Bay Trail, taking hikers from Oakland to Albany.\n\nEmeryville Marina McLaughlin Eastshore State Park • Albany Bulb In West Oakland, the Bay Trail follows streets through the busy trade and transportation zone of the Port of Oakland. Along 3rd Street, the bike lanes and sidewalks curve under the web of highway overpasses to Mandela Parkway. At 8th Street and Mandela, the trail splits. One leg heads towards the heart of the Port to Middle Harbor Shoreline Park and Portview Park. Breathtaking views of the Bay Bridge and the San Francisco and Oakland skylines can be seen from almost everywhere in these parks with the observation tower at Middle Harbor offering the most spectacular birds-eye views. At 7th Street, take the path along Maritime Street north through a busy port area to the Bay Bridge Trail. From 8th Street and Mandela, the trail route heads north along Mandela Parkway to Emeryville. Follow Mandela through the industrial zone of West Oakland, stopping to visit Cypress Memorial Park built in memory to those who lost their lives here in the 1989 Loma Prieta Earthquake. Mandela terminates at a shopping center; head left on Horton and left again on 40th Street to ramp over the railroad tracks. Where 40th Street turns into Shellmound Street, look for another entry to the Bay Bridge Trail to Yerba Buena Island. A future park, known as Judge John Sutter Regional Shoreline, will be constructed at the base of the Bay Bridge serving as an entry point to the path on the bridge. Continuing through Emeryville, use city streets to reach Christie Avenue, then take the trail along Christie Avenue and Powell Street and pass under the highway. Continue straight on Powell towards the bay to reach the Emeryville City Marina or turn right to follow the Bay Trail north towards Albany. This is the southern edge of Eastshore State Park. The trail passes Point Emery on its way to Berkeley, where it ducks under the Berkeley bicycle/pedestrian bridge over Highway 80. Take the bridge inland to visit Aquatic Park. Detour west along University Avenue to the Berkeley Marina, Shorebird Park, and Cesar Chavez Park. Rounding the edge of Golden Gate Fields, the Albany Mudflats Ecological Reserve is straight ahead. To your left is Albany Bulb, popular for its spectacular views of the bay and found art exhibits. The Bay Trail continues north squeezing between the highway and the mudflats en route to Richmond."

It is in close proximity to Monterey's Cannery Row, in the heart of Pacific Grove, and has a highly popular conference center for retreats. If you need a break from the regular tourist stuff, this is a great option.\n\nThe trail goes between soft and compacted sand to wood-paneled walkways with small gazebo outlooks. It is an easy walk with only a few rocks to watch out for. There are all sorts of possibilities here for ocean kayaking, paddle boarding, and diving. Being in Northern California, the water is cold and not suitable for casual swimming.\n\nThe beach and bluff walk provide ready access to spectacular coastline, tide pools, marine mammal and offshore preserves, kelp beds, and more. It's extremely popular locally for morning and afternoon walks. It's accessible, tucked between the coastal road and the ocean, and one of those places that's gorgeous no matter the weather. \n\nAccording to Access Northern CA (http://accessnca.org/access-northern-california/explore/explore-detail-view/?site_id=13): The grounds, restrooms, restaurant, and gift shop at Asilomar Conference Grounds are open to the public. An accessible boardwalk travels from the conference grounds to the beach and over sand dunes, offering a rare close-up glimpse of a dune restoration project. Guided nature walks are offered by State Parks, free of charge. Check for times at the registration building (Social Hall) on the conference grounds. You can also rent bicycles and pick up a leaflet describing dune plants.\n\nCalifornia State Parks maintains this trail network.\n\nAccessibility:\n\nquipment\nVisitors using wheelchairs, mobility equipment, or strollers may need all-terrain tires or adaptive equipment for the surface type and grade.\n\nParking\nThere are 2 designated van-accessible parking spaces with striped access aisles in the paved parking lot.\n\nSurface\nThe trail surface is sand, paved asphalt, or wooden boardwalk with edge railings and is typically at least 3 feet wide. Sand blown onto the trail may impact surface firmness.\n\nGrade\nThis trail is estimated to be mostly gentle (5% or less), with some moderately steep (5-8%) sections that may require assistance or need to be avoided.\n\nMore Info\nA portion of this trail may not be accessible to visitors using wheelchairs, mobility equipment, or strollers. The most accessible portion of this route is the Conference Grounds Dune Boardwalk (first .4 miles), which follows a boardwalk with benches and areas to turn around. The transitions to the boardwalk may have a lip of greater than 2 inches. \n\nTo enjoy the longest accessible stretch of the Coast Trail (under 0.5 mile), start at Jewell Avenue. If you go north from Jewell Ave, you will soon come to a lovely covered overlook with benches. The trail continues a little farther, then curves back to Ocean View Blvd. Traveling south from Jewell, the trail hugs the shoreline. If sections of sand are too deep, manual wheelchair riders or stroller users may need to backtrack to one of the exits at the accessible parking locations and use the bike lane along Ocean View Blvd to continue south. Traffic is light and speeds are slow. \n\nBeach wheelchairs are available for loan with a reservation at the store inside the Asilomar Registration Building. \n\nThere are wheelchair-accessible restrooms in the registration building, wheelchair accessible picnic tables (with a firm and stable path to the tables, firm and stable surface, and at least 27 inches of knee clearance).\n\nTake caution when crossing roadways; designated crosswalks are present. Traffic noise may be present on this route. This trail has little shade, so wearing appropriate sun protection is recommended."

Be sure to look for a metal sculpture shaped like a whale on the fence to your left. Interpretive panels along the trail describe common plants and wildlife and offer a bit of local history.\n\nRight before you reach the blufftop viewing area, you will pass a rickety, inaccessible porta-potty next to where the Cowell-Purisima trail heads south. Continue past the trail to the bluff, where you can look down on Cowell Ranch Beach to the north. To the south, you can see a rocky cove where harbor seals like to haul out. They tend to be here from late winter through spring - use binoculars or the lowered telescope to look for seal pups in March and April. After about one mile, you come to an interpretive sign marking the site of an ancient Ohlone village."

Beginning in Alameda's Towata Park at the base of the Bay Farm Island Bridge, enter the Elsie Roemer Bird Sanctuary, stopping to view shorebirds and waterfowl from observation platforms.\n\nContinue on 2.5 miles of paved trail along Crown Memorial State Beach, the bay's largest and warmest beach. Near McKay Avenue, you'll find the Crab Cove Visitor Center, a great place for kids to learn about the bay with hands-on classrooms in Crab Cove. \n\nThe Bay Trail traverses Main Street Linear Park on the way to the Alameda Ferry Terminal. Although the city of Alameda has long-range plans for a shoreline trail along the Estuary, to encircle the island you will need to use city streets on the northern, eastern, and parts of the western sides. Jump over to Oakland on the Fruitvale Bridge or the High Street Bridge. \n\nThe Oakland Waterfront Pathway is a work in progress and can get complicated. The city's 19-mile waterfront is a dynamic mix of world trade and local industry, old warehouses and modern condominiums, yachts and container ships. Between High Street and Jack London Square, short segments of the Bay Trail are in place providing access to the edge of the Oakland Estuary, but they are not connected. \n\nVisit the trail between Fruitvale and High streets, Fruitvale and Park Avenue, Union Point Park, Embarcadero Cove, and Estuary Park. Bike lanes and sidewalks along Embarcadero serve as an inland connection to some of these waterfront destinations. The trail around Lake Merritt is worth exploring, accessible to the Bay Trail only along city streets. There are plans to eventually connect the trails at Lake Merritt with the Bay Trail at Estuary Park.\n\nVisit Jack London Square, the public hub of Oakland's waterfront and learn about its rich history. Take a cruise on the Alameda-Oakland Ferry as it  runs between Jack London Square, Alameda, and San Francisco's Ferry Building and Pier 39. To reach Middle Harbor Shoreline Park and Portview Park use bike lanes and sidewalks along city streets and be rewarded with breathtaking views. Continue north to Emeryville along city streets via Mandela Parkway or to the Bay Bridge Trail along the path on Maritime Street."

The route is an out-and-back on Camp Ohlone Road, a wide, uneven, dirt and gravel trail. The three pedestrian gates are accessible for people using wheelchairs. There are several very steep sections on this hike. The path follows the course of Alameda Creek with a scenic view at Alameda Creek Overlook.\n\nPark Features: Chochenyo Ohlone- speaking Taunan peoples were this area’s first inhabitants. Later, since the 1860s, homesteaders ranched the land. Under the District's multi-use land management policy, cattle continue to graze many parts of the 6,859-acre wilderness. Today, picnicking, hiking, and backpacking attract thousands of park visitors a year. There is no drinking water in the park and poor cell phone reception.\n\nTrail Directions: This hike begins at the far end of the road, past the park entrance kiosk. Go through the cattle gate at the end of the parking lot, cross the bridge, and begin following Camp Ohlone Road. Over the next mile, you’ll pass through two more gates before arriving at the Alameda Creek Overlook. There is a non-accessible vault toilet and picnic bench here. Continue on Camp Ohlone Road, heading up an incline, until you reach the park boundary. Turn around here and follow the same route back to the beginning."

    "description": "This is a segment of the San Francisco Bay Trail: a 500 mile long mile trail around the Bay. This is the 11th section of the Bay Trail. The Bay Trail is currently under construction, but will ultimately take pedestrians across the San Francisco - Oakland Bay Bridge. There is currently no way to complete the route along the Bridge from Treasure Island to San Francisco, but trail construction is in progress. If you wish to reach San Francisco from Treasure Island instead of going back to Oakland, you can take bus 25. \n\nFor more information, visit: https://mtc.ca.gov/operations/regional-trails-parks/san-francisco-bay-trail/bay-trail-navigational-map\n\nIn 1955, the American Society of Civil Engineers honored the San Francisco Oakland Bay Bridge as one of the seven “Modern Civil Engineering Wonders” of the world. At first, the bridge carried autos on its top deck, and trucks, buses, and two tracks for the Key System rail service on the lower deck. In 1958, the rails were removed and both levels were assigned to motor vehicles. Today, the Bay has been transformed with the new east span of the San Francisco Oakland Bay Bridge. \n\nRising over the bay between Oakland and Yerba Buena Island, a self-anchored suspension span extends for 2.2 miles with a single signature tower. Following damage to the east span as a result of the Loma Prieta Earthquake in 1989, it was determined that the existing span would be completely replaced. Under construction since 2002, the new bridge opened in 2013 with a 15-foot-wide bicycle and pedestrian path on its southern edge. Take the four mile Bay Bridge Trail from the entryway off Shellmound Street in Emeryville to Yerba Buena Island and gaze up at the aweinspiring tower of the new Bay Bridge. \n\nWork to plan, design, and complete the bicycle/pedestrian connection between Yerba Buena Island and San Francisco on the West Span of the Bay Bridge is underway. Where the bridge lands in Oakland, a future regional park, known as Judge John Sutter Regional Shoreline, is being planned to welcome travelers to the East Bay and to serve as an entry point for the bridge pathway.\n\nEast Span Bay Bridge Tower Treasure Island was created with bay fill in the late 1930s, and was the site for the 1939–40 Golden Gate International Exposition or World's Fair. Some 4,000 trees and 2 million flowering plants were planted for the occasion. Many of the palms and varieties of eucalyptus are still alive. Future redevelopment plans include a mix of residential, hotel, marinas, restaurants, retail and entertainment venues—plus nearly 300 acres of parks and open space. With this project, a new segment of the Bay Trail will encircle the island and connect to the Bay Bridge pathway. Two segments of Bay Trail currently exist on Treasure Island and are worth a visit."

Encompassing 30,000 acres, the Don Edwards refuge consists primarily of tidal marsh, salt ponds, mud flats, and seasonal wetlands. It provides habitat for nine species of federally listed threatened or endangered species, including the salt marsh harvest mouse, California clapper rail, and western snowy plover, and is home to 227 species of birds. As a safe haven for vast numbers of birds traveling the Pacific Flyway, it is a prime destination for bird watching.\n\nPublic entry points for visiting Don Edwards are at its headquarters at the refuge's north end in Fremont, and at Alviso, which is around the southern tip of San Francisco Bay. More than 30 miles of trails lead along sloughs and past salt ponds on San Francisco Bay that are being restored to a mix of habitats. Depending on the season and the stage of salt development, the water ranges in color from green to mauve. A visitor center in Fremont and the Environmental Education Center in Alviso provide information about the refuge and how to explore it.\n\nAt the Fremont location there’s an accessible fishing pier at the end of Marshlands Road; from there you can also pick up a section of the Bay Trail that crosses the approximately 1.5-mile Dumbarton Bridge to San Mateo County. From Marshlands Road you can also follow the Quarry Trail to Coyote Hills Regional Park via a bridge that crosses Highway 84.\n\nAccessibility: There are firm, designated accessible parking spaces with a 2% slope or less at the visitor center, in the large lot behind it, and at the end of Marshlands Rd by the fishing pier. The trail surface is loose dirt/gravel and it is typically at least four feet wide.\n\nBefore starting out on the trail, you can travel a short distance up a very steep service road to a platform with broad views of the marshlands, salt ponds, sloughs, and Bay. Further uphill are more trails, but they have very steep grades. To begin your hike, from the service road travel a few hundred feet downhill to a trail junction and an accessible picnic area overlooking the marsh. For the most wheelchair accessible route, follow the Tidelands Trail to the right.\n\nContinue following signs for the Tidelands Trail, then cross an accessible long wooden bridge over Newark Slough to the junction with Newark Slough Trail. Here an abandoned hunting lodge has interpretive panels. At this junction, the trail is named both Newark Slough and Tidelands. Traveling in either direction, the 5.2-mile Newark Slough levee loop trail follows the curving path of Newark Slough around salt ponds and tidal marshes. Refuge staff advise that sections of the loop are inaccessible due to overgrown vegetation and narrow dirt passages. You can follow it to the left for 0.25 miles to another accessible wooden bridge, then travel uphill and reconnect with the Tidelands Trail. Here you can turn left and follow the trail 0.25 miles back to the start, or turn right to connect to the Harrier Spur Trail.\n\nAs the trail curves inland, noise dissipates, the East Bay hills come into view. In less than 0.3 miles you reach the Harrier Spur Trail, which the map says is accessible. However, it has a steep approach so you may want to follow the signs for Tidelands Trail back to the start instead.\n\nThe visitor center is wheelchair accessible. There are accessible restrooms outside the visitor center and accessible portable toilets halfway out to the fishing pier and by the picnic tables and overlook at the start of the lower Tidelands Trail. There are accessible picnic tables with a firm and stable path and surface and at least 27 inches of knee clearance at the visitor center, the trail junction for the Learning Center and Tidelands Trail, and the Learning Center. Halfway along the boardwalk over Newark Slough, an area that juts out over the marsh has a few tables, and there is one past the second bridge crossing."

Hiking, jogging, kite flying, dog walking, and picnicking are some of the activities to be enjoyed on this ridgetop refuge.\n\nTrail Highlights: The seasonal creek is active in the winter months and into spring, depending on rainfall. Enjoy the pleasant groves of oak trees sprawling throughout the park. Delight in views of the San Ramon, Dublin, and Pleasanton valleys, with Mount Diablo as the backdrop. There are no restroom facilities, so plan ahead.\n\nTrail Directions: Begin southwest on Grey Fox Trail. Walk .06 miles and take the first right onto Stream View Trail. The trail splits off around the bottom of the seasonal creek: keep to the path left/southwest of the creek (though either route will lead back to the same trail). There is a brief uphill section before the hiker-only section of the Stream View meets the wider multi-use section of Stream View. Take a right at that junction and continue along Stream View above and parallel to the creek. The last section of Stream View Trail heads steeply uphill, away from the creek, gaining an elevation of about 400 feet. Atop this small hill, *turn left onto Redtail Hawk Trail. Follow the trail for .18 miles, turning left onto Grey Fox Trail to finish the loop. This final stretch of the hike will take you back to the start and grace you with sweeping views of Mount Diablo to the northeast.\n\n*If you would like to extend your hike, turn right onto Redtail Hawk Trail.

    "description": "Enjoy the beauty of the San Francisco Bay Trail. This section in Foster City can be completed in a loop and offers scenic views. This paved path offers chances for kite-flying and watching the kite-boarders in the Bay. Kids (and some adults too) will enjoy watching the airplanes landing nearby. This route also goes by Shoreline Park which encompasses Ryder Park and Seal Point Park.\n\nAccording to Access Northern CA (http://accessnca.org/access-northern-california/explore/explore-detail-view/?site_id=171): The Bay Trail is a recreational corridor that, when complete, will encircle San Francisco and San Pablo bays with a continuous 500-mile network of bicycling and hiking trails—much of it wheelchair and stroller accessible. \n\nThe Bay is just to your left nearly all the way on this trail, and to your right, or right in front of you, is one little park after another. A half-mile out from Coyote Point you will see a very steep path running inland to small Harbor View Park, which people use mainly for baseball games and picnics. A half-mile farther is Ryder Park, with an accessible playground, group picnic area, outdoor classrooms, and restored wetlands. A large, tiered, concrete “water art” piece, the Shell Mound Gurgle, demonstrates how tidal action works.\n\nAccessibility: There is designated, van-accessible parking at the parking lot behind the yacht club at Coyote Point Recreation Area, and at Ryder, Seal Point, and Bayside/Joinville Parks. At the entry to the Bay Trail from the parking lot behind the yacht club, an exceptionally large divot makes passage difficult. \n\nThe trail surface is paved or gravel and it is typically at least five feet wide. It is gentle in grade, all estimated to be 3% or less. Continuous cross-slopes may be tiresome for some manual wheelchair or stroller users. At Seal Point Park the side trail to lookout points are on firm terrain. There are accessible bathrooms at Ryder Park, Bayside/Joinville Park, and Seal Point Park and accessible picnic tables (with firm and stable paths and surfaces and at least 27 inches of knee clearance) at Ryder Park and Harbor View Park."

For more information, please visit https://www.ebparks.org/parks/sunol\n\nThis is a wide gravel road with hilly views and some views of the creek below. \n\nAccording to Access Northern California (https://accessnca.org/access-northern-california/explore/explore-detail-view/?site_id=243): Bedrock mortars used by Native Americans for pounding acorns that were found in the area are reminders of Sunol's first inhabitants. For the past century, however, the land known today as Sunol Wilderness Regional Preserve was used almost exclusively as ranch land. Cattle continue to graze in the 6,859-acre wilderness but visitors can enjoy camping, picnicking, and hiking. The park is most popular in the spring when Alameda Creek is flowing, and the hills are green with wildflowers.\n\nSeveral trails offer some accessibility with Camp Ohlone Rd being the longest and most accessible, albeit with continuous grades.\n\nThis 2-mile out and back, the hilly hike follows Alameda Creek (not always visible or running) past oak woodlands and weathered serpentine and sandstone outcrops. Alder, willow, and sycamore are seen creekside. It’s best to complete this hike on a cooler day as the route is fully exposed and the elevation gain can be very challenging in hot weather.\n\nStart by crossing a paved bridge over Alameda Creek but shortly after the trail turns to hard-packed dirt and gravel. Just beyond the first gate, adjacent to the first of three cattle guard crossings, a mostly level, dirt spur trail goes off to the right and gets you closer to the creek and lots of wildflowers in the spring (California poppies, mustard, goldfields, and lupines) on this short detour, and elsewhere. After less than .2 miles you'll need to backtrack to reconnect to the main trail.\n\nFor the first .3 miles, the grade is 8% or less but afterward, sections can be greater than 11%. The inclines and declines are mostly continuous so be prepared for a good workout. Acorn woodpeckers, butterflies, and damselflies were plentiful along the route.\n\nAt 1.1 miles you will reach the third and final cattle gate, continue another .1 mile to reach “Alameda Creek Overlook” (formerly known as Little Yosemite). The overlook is best in the wetter months when there’s more water. This is a good point to turn back however, according to an elevation chart if you continue for another .8 mile the grade is less than 8%, thereafter it increases.\n\nThere are some level stretches but for the most part, continually ascends and descends. The grade for the initial .3 miles is 8% or less but afterward sections can be greater than 11% Very wide service road except for the spur trail which is less than 4ft. wide\n\nAccessibility: Visitors using wheelchairs, mobility equipment, or strollers may need all-terrain tires or adaptive/motorized equipment for the surface type and grade. Visitors using wheelchairs, mobility equipment, or strollers may need assistance along this entire route due to the consistent sections above a 5% grade (especially if using manual equipment).\n\nAccessible Parking:\nNumber of designated accessible spaces: 1 at the trailhead;\nNumber of van-accessible spaces with access aisles: 1;\nParking lot surface: paved.\n\nTrail Details:\nTrail surface: gravel;\nAverage trail width: 10 feet;\nEstimated average grade category: moderately steep (5-8%) with a steeper section at about 0.8 miles when going east;\nPicnic tables: yes, firm and stable path to tables, firm and stable surface, 27\" or greater knee clearance; Several tables are in Alameda Grove nearby to the Camp Ohlone Rd. trailhead. All have access at each end of the table and the path of travel to them is thick with plant debris and bumpy in places but, should be manageable for most individuals. Other tables are by the visitor center and only have access at each end.\nOther accessible features: Accessible restrooms are located throughout the park and are typically located near the accessible parking. A 3-4 inch threshold at the visitor center restroom and a degraded threshold at the restroom across from Ohlone Wilderness Trailhead, may impede access for some. There is a small, accessible visitor center to learn about recent animal sightings and to meet some animal ambassadors: a gopher snake, rattlesnake, western toad, western pond turtle, and a tarantula. You can also view samples of over 600 plant specimens found in the park."

The bridge spans a total length of 1.7 miles, but most people only walk to the first tower and back again.\n\nIf you are feeling more adventurous, walk across the bridge and continue under the bridge up to the Hendrik Point vista point for a great view of the bridge with the San Francisco skyline in the background. You will also have a great view of Alcatraz and even the Bay Bridge from here. From the Marin side of the Golden Gate Bridge you can continue into the Marin Headlands or head down into Sausalito along the Bay Trail.\n\nThis is a very popular route across the Golden Gate Bridge all the way to Sausalito. You also have the option to hop on the ferry with your bike and come right back to San Francisco. \n\nAccessibility: There is a wheelchair-accessible ramp leading from the Visitors Center up to the bridge entrance with handrails and a gentle slope. Once on the Bridge, the path is paved, flat (estimated 1% or less), and typically at least six feet wide. There is a safety barrier protecting pedestrians and cyclists from motor vehicle traffic on the Bridge. There is a wheelchair accessible bathroom with grab bars in a separate building across from the Visitor Center at the south end of the Bridge."

The trail tread up to the dam is considered wheelchair friendly but beyond that is a little more difficult with some narrow and uneven areas including a hillside traverse - not recommended for strollers or wheelchairs - but there are places to turn around before then.\n\nThis route can be made more adventurous by connecting to the open space preserves to the north (Russian Ridge Open Space Preserve) and south (Long Ridge Open Space Preserve); there's even an old Christmas tree farm to the south.\n\nThere are benches along the way for resting. There are gravel parking areas at the start of the trail on the north end but they do not appear to have designated accessible parking spaces."

For more information, please visit https://www.ebparks.org/parks/coyote-hills\n\nCoyote Hills offers diverse lessons in history and many activities. At the Visitor Center, you can learn about Ohlone history, settlers and ranching, salt production, bio-sonar research, and more! Other features include picnic areas, groups camps, the Alameda Creek Trail, the marsh boardwalk, the wildlife refuge, and salt evaporation ponds. Coyote Hills is a haven for cyclists, joggers, walkers, birdwatchers, nature explorers, and picnickers. \n\nThis level-pathed, Bayview trail is mostly paved and offers astounding views of the National Wildlife refuge, salt evaporation ponds of the San Francisco Bay, shoreline birds, and the water. This hike is in full sun with little shade, but the Bayview trail has a wonderful breeze before you make your climb and limber up for the many steep inclines (7) and declines (5) that the Red Hill trail has to offer. The rock formations and views from the top of Red Hill make it all worthwhile. Enjoy a snack or break and 360-degree views at the hilltop picnic areas on Red Hill, before you head back on the soaproot trail to make your way back to Bayview trail to complete the loop. \n\nBegin at Quarry Staging Area off Patterson Ranch Road. Follow the paved Bay View Trail west for .28 miles until you reach the Dairy Glen group campsite. Stay left before the campground on the loose gravel Meadowlark-to-Bayview Trail for .14 miles (with the South marsh at left). At the intersection with No Name Trail and Apay Way, continue straight towards the Bay View Trail. The gravel path will continue to No Name trail, veer to the right on the paved trail, this is the Bay View Trail continued and you will follow it along the water until you reach Red Hill Trail about 2.1 miles into your hike. When you come to the observation platform and viewing area on the Bay View Trail, follow it to the right around the bend and Red Hill will be ahead of where you will make a sharp right onto the trail going uphill to start your climb, there will be a trail post sign for the Red Hill Trail to guide you. Follow the Red Hill Trail for about .9 miles until you reach your last decline. At the bottom of the hill, you will take a left on the Soaproot trail and follow it back to the Bay View trail for about .3 miles at the bottom of Soaproot make your way back towards the Dairy Glen group campsite, walk towards the campsite and veer to the left which takes you back to the paved Bay View Trail and another .28 miles back to the staging area to complete the loop.  \n\nAccessibility: There are 3 unlined designated accessible spaces in the gravel parking lot off of Patterson Ranch Road at the east end of the trail. None of them appear to be van-accessible with striped access aisles. The trail surface is paved asphalt, gravel, or a natural surface (dirt). It is typically at least 6 feet wide.\n\nThe most accessible portion of the trail is the paved Bayview Trail in the first about 2.1 miles when going clockwise. The majority of the trail is estimated to be in the mostly gentle (5% or less) grade category but there are steeper sections from about 2.1-3.5 miles when going clockwise. Trail goers using wheelchairs/mobility equipment or strollers may need assistance in the steeper sections or to avoid them for safety. All-terrain tires or motorized equipment may be needed for the surface type and grade after about 2.1 miles. There are benches along the route for resting."
